The Cosmo Platform is entirely Open Source.

## Releases

Tagged releases are published in the exact version to NPMJS.com and Github Container Registry.

### Release Notes

Every release contains a summary of features, bug fixes, breaking changes, and optionally a migration guide. You can find all official releases at [WunderGraph Cosmo Releases](https://github.com/wundergraph/cosmo/releases).

All published docker images are listed at [WunderGraph Cosmo Packages](https://github.com/orgs/wundergraph/packages?repo_name=cosmo).

## Docker tagging strategy

For every pull request and merge into the main branch, we build separate Docker images.

Official releases are tagged as follows:

```bash
ghcr.io/wundergraph/cosmo/router:0.9.0
```

Images built on main are tagged with:

```bash
ghcr.io/wundergraph/cosmo/router:latest
ghcr.io/wundergraph/cosmo/router:sha-12345
```

For more information, check out the release [documentation](https://github.com/wundergraph/cosmo/blob/main/docs/releasing.md).

## Router binaries

For every Router release, we build binaries for all operating systems and attach them to the [Github release](https://github.com/wundergraph/cosmo/releases/tag/router%400.22.1).

### Helm Charts

We publish Helm charts for the Cosmo Platform and the Router. You can find them on [Artifact Hub](https://artifacthub.io/packages/search?org=wundergraph).

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="cosmo-router" icon="github" horizontal href="https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/cosmo-router/router" />
  <Card title="cosmo-platform" icon="github" horizontal href="https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/cosmo-platform/cosmo" />
</CardGroup>


Both charts are part of the [Cosmo Repository](https://github.com/wundergraph/cosmo) :
