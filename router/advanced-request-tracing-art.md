# Advanced Request Tracing (ART)

{% hint style="warning" %}
Enabling Advanced Request Tracing may pose a potential security risk. For this reason, we have implemented a mechanism to ensure secure communication from Cosmo Studio to your routers. A router with version **0.42.1** or **higher** is required.
{% endhint %}

Advanced Request Tracing (ART) renders the Execution Plan including verbose information about how it was resolved as a JSON and adds it to the GraphQL response in the "extensions" part of the response using the "trace" key.

You get the following information from ART

* planning timings, e.g. how long it took to generate an execution plan
* the general structure of the execution plan
* the types of fetches (load operations) the Router does, like parallel, serial, entity, batch entity, etc.
* what actual requests are being sent to the Subgraphs
* what data was used to render the input for a load operation
* the rendered input of a load operation
* the output of a load operation
* the timings, like latency, of a load operation

All of this information can be quite useful to fully understand how the Router resolves a request and why it might be slow or behave unexpectedly.

### Configuration

For convenience, **Advanced Request Tracing is enabled by default**. When starting the Router, a warning indicates if the feature is active.

To fully disable Advanced Request Tracing, set the following environment variable:

```bash
ENGINE_ENABLE_REQUEST_TRACING=false
```

### Request Parameters

To use Advanced Request Tracing, you need to either use Request Headers or Query Parameters. To disable ART, simply omit the "X-WG-Trace" Header or the "wg\_trace" Query Parameter.

#### Headers

You must set the following Header to enable tracing

```bash
X-WG-Trace=true
```

#### Query Parameter

It's also possible to use Query Parameters

```bash
POST http://example.com/graphql?wg_trace=true
```

#### Optional Arguments

Other (optional) arguments that are available:

* exclude\_planner\_stats (exclude planner timings in the trace)
* exclude\_raw\_input\_data (exclude the raw input data for a loader)
* exclude\_input (exclude the rendered input data for a loader)
* exclude\_output (exclude the output of a loader)
* exclude\_load\_stats (exclude load stats like latency)
* enable\_predictable\_debug\_timings (useful for debugging, makes timings constant)

### Examples

#### Enable Advanced Tracing but exclude planner stats and input via Header

```bash
X-WG-Trace=exclude_planner_stats,exclude_input
```

#### Enable Advanced Tracing but exclude output via Query Parameters

```bash
POST http://example.com/graphql?wg_trace=exclude_output
```

## Development

In the development playground, Advanced Request Tracing (ART) can be enabled by setting the environment variable `DEV_MODE` to true and using the following header in the playground:

```json
{
  "X-WG-TRACE" : "true"
}
```
