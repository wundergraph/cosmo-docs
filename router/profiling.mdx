Profiling is an essential aspect of optimizing Go applications, as it helps identify bottlenecks, deadlocks, and inefficient code paths. Since the router is a Go application, you can leverage Go's built-in [`pprof`](https://go.dev/blog/pprof) package for memory and CPU profiling. This section provides guidance on setting up and retrieving profiles using `pprof`. These profiles are valuable for troubleshooting issues and can sometimes be the only way to gain meaningful context.

## Enable Profiling

To enable the `pprof` endpoints, start the router with the following environment variable:

```bash
PPROF_ADDR=:6060
```

<Info>
  The `pprof` HTTP server will be accessible at `http://localhost:6060`. **Exposing this endpoint to production environments is highly discouraged** due to security risks.
</Info>

This makes the following endpoints available:

* `/debug/pprof/heap` — Memory profile.

* `/debug/pprof/profile` — CPU profile.

* `/debug/pprof/goroutine` — Goroutine profile.

* `/debug/pprof/threadcreate` — Thread creation profile.

* `/debug/pprof/block` — Block profile.

## Downloading the Appropriate Profiles

To troubleshoot issues effectively, categorize them into the following three types:
<CardGroup>
  <Card title="CPU Utilization" href="/router/profiling#1-cpu-utilization" icon="square-1" horizontal/>
  <Card title="Memory Utilization" href="/router/profiling#2-memory-utilization" icon="square-2" horizontal/>
  <Card title="Blocking and synchronization" href="/router/profiling#3-blocking-and-synchronization" icon="square-3" horizontal/>
</CardGroup>

Depending on the issue, you can download individual profiles or [generate a ZIP](/router/profiling#best-practices-for-capturing-and-sharing-performance-profiles) archive containing a set of basic profiles. This is useful when you can't categorize the issue yourself.

### **1. CPU Utilization**

To investigate CPU-related issues, you can fetch the CPU profile by running:

```bash
curl http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/profile\?seconds\=30 > profile.out  # Download
go tool pprof -http 127.0.0.1:8079 profile.out # Visualize
```

This command captures a 30-second CPU profile by default helping you identify functions consuming excessive CPU time.

### **2. Memory Utilization**

To diagnose memory-related issues, you can download the heap profile:

```bash
curl http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/heap > heap.out # Download
go tool pprof -http 127.0.0.1:8079 heap.out # Visualize
```

This command captures a snapshot of memory allocations, allowing you to identify memory leaks or excessive memory usage.

### **3. Blocking and Synchronization**

To identify deadlocks or goroutine-related issues, you can fetch the goroutine profile:

```bash
curl http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/goroutine?debug=2 > goroutine.txt
```

This command provides a detailed stack trace of all active goroutines, which is helpful for detecting deadlocks or excessive blocking.

**Additional profiles for diagnosing blocking and synchronization issues:**

* **Block Profile:** Captures blocking events caused by synchronization primitives.

  ```bash
  go tool pprof http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/block
  ```

* **Thread Creation Profile:** Identifies issues related to excessive thread creation.

  ```bash
  go tool pprof http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/threadcreate
  ```

By using these profiles effectively, you can pinpoint performance bottlenecks and improve the efficiency of your Go application. For further analysis, consider using the `go tool pprof` interactive commands such as `top`, `list`, `peek`, and `web`.

## **Best Practices for Capturing and Sharing Performance Profiles**

By attaching these profiles, you provide invaluable information for diagnosing performance bottlenecks and crashes efficiently! <Icon icon="rocket" />

### **Considerations Before Exporting:**

* **Run with a real workload:** Capture profiles during actual usage scenarios to ensure meaningful data.

* **Use an adequate duration:** For CPU profiles, longer capture times (10–30 seconds) yield more useful information.

* **Avoid noise:** Terminate other background processes to minimize interference in the profiles.

### **Automation Script for Linux and macOS**

Use the following script to automate the steps described above, and then attach the archive to an issue or send it to us via Slack.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Set variables for profile files
CPU_PROFILE="cpu.prof"
MEM_PROFILE="mem.prof"
GOROUTINE_PROFILE="goroutine.prof"
ZIP_FILE="profiles_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).zip"

# Create a temporary directory to store profiles
TEMP_DIR=$(mktemp -d)
echo "Creating temporary directory: $TEMP_DIR"

# Download profiles if the application has a pprof HTTP server running
echo "Downloading profiles..."
curl -o "$TEMP_DIR/$MEM_PROFILE" "http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/heap"
curl -o "$TEMP_DIR/$GOROUTINE_PROFILE" "http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/goroutine"
echo "Capturing CPU profile for 10 seconds..."
curl -o "$TEMP_DIR/$CPU_PROFILE" "http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/profile?seconds=10"

# Check if the profiles were downloaded successfully
if [[ -f "$TEMP_DIR/$CPU_PROFILE" && -f "$TEMP_DIR/$MEM_PROFILE" && -f "$TEMP_DIR/$GOROUTINE_PROFILE" ]]; then
    echo "Profiles downloaded successfully!"
else
    echo "Failed to download some profiles. Please check if the pprof HTTP server is running on port 6060."
    exit 1
fi

# Create a zip file with all profiles
echo "Creating zip archive: $ZIP_FILE"
zip -j "$ZIP_FILE" "$TEMP_DIR/$CPU_PROFILE" "$TEMP_DIR/$MEM_PROFILE" "$TEMP_DIR/$GOROUTINE_PROFILE"

# Clean up temporary files
rm -rf "$TEMP_DIR"

echo "Profiles collected and zipped successfully: $ZIP_FILE"
```

The resulting ZIP file will have the following flat structure:

```bash
profiles_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.zip
├── cpu.prof
├── mem.prof
├── goroutine.prof
```
