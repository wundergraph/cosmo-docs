Prometheus 3.0 introduces [support](https://www.prometheus.io/docs/guides/opentelemetry/) for OTLP (OpenTelemetry Protocol) metrics ingestion, enabling direct push of OpenTelemetry metrics to Prometheus without requiring metrics exposure via HTTP. This simplifies configuration and helps consolidate your monitoring setup. Additionally, since high cardinality has traditionally impacted the performance of scraping large server fleets, moving from a pull (scrape) to a push model reduces the impact of cardinality on performance. However, depending on your Prometheus storage backend, cardinality remains an important metric to monitor and manage over time.

Below is an example configuration for pushing all metrics to Prometheus:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash config.yaml
  telemetry:
    metrics:
      otlp:
        exporters:
          - endpoint: "localhost:9090"
            exporter: http
            path: /api/v1/otlp/v1/metrics
            temporality: cumulative # Important
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Docker Compose Example

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash docker-compose.yml
    prometheus:
      image: prom/prometheus:v3.0.0-beta.1
      command:
        - --web.enable-otlp-receiver
      networks:
        - primary
      extra_hosts:
        # https://medium.com/@TimvanBaarsen/how-to-connect-to-the-docker-host-from-inside-a-docker-container-112b4c71bc66
        - 'host.docker.internal:host-gateway'
      ports:
        - '9090:9090'
  ```
</CodeGroup>
