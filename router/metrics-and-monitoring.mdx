In both configurations, we export [(R.E.D)](https://thenewstack.io/monitoring-microservices-red-method/) metrics related to incoming GraphQL traffic.

## Open Telemetry (OTEL) & Prometheus

OTEL metrics are the foundation for both the OTEL and Prometheus metric storage models. Internally, we track metrics using the OTEL instrumentation library and export them via a Prometheus exporter. This process converts the metrics to be compatible with both formats. As a result, we aim to expose the same metrics consistently across both models, with a few exceptions:

* We do not expose [asynchronous instruments](/router/metrics-and-monitoring#asynchronous-instruments) through Prometheus. This decision is pending further feedback collection.

* In Prometheus, metrics are formatted in snake\_case and conclude with specific suffixes.

## Metrics

### Synchronous and asynchronous instruments

OpenTelemetry instruments are either synchronous or asynchronous. Synchronous instruments take a measurement when they are called e.g. when a request is made. The measurement is done as another call during program execution, just like any other function call. Periodically, the aggregation of these measurements is exported by a configured exporter.

Asynchronous instruments, on the other hand, provide a measurement at an interval, not triggered explicitly through program execution. All measurements on asynchronous instruments are performed once per export cycle.

By default, the routers exports OTEL data **every** 15 seconds.

### List of synchronous instruments

We collect the following metrics to get useful insights in the HTTP traffic:

* `router.http.requests`: Total count of incoming requests.

* `router.http.response.content_length`: Total bytes of incoming requests

* `router.http.request.content_length`: Total bytes of outgoing responses

* `router.http.request.duration_milliseconds`: End-to-end duration of incoming requests in (histogram)

* `router.http.requests.in_flight`: Number of in-flight requests. (Only static and subgraph dimensions are attached)

* `router.http.requests.error`: Total number of failed requests.

#### GraphQL specific metrics

`router.graphql.operation.planning_time`: Time taken to plan the operation. An additional attribute `wg.engine.plan_cache_hit` indicates if the plan was served from the cache.

### List of asynchronous instruments

<Info>
  All asynchronous metrics are tracked from the router start. If polling is enabled, the router will serve different metric series when the server has swapped.
</Info>

We collect the following metrics to gain useful insights into the router's runtime behavior. Asynchronous metrics are not exposed on the Prometheus endpoint.

* `runtime.uptime`: Seconds since application was initialized

* `server.uptime`: Seconds since the server was initialized. Typically, this time represents how long a specific version of the graph has been running when polling from the controlplane is enabled.

* `process.cpu.usage`: Total CPU usage of this process in percentage of host total CPU capacity

* `process.runtime.go.mem.heap_alloc`: Bytes of allocated heap objects

* `process.runtime.go.mem.heap_idle`: Bytes in idle (unused) spans

* `process.runtime.go.mem.heap_inuse`: Bytes in in-use spans

* `process.runtime.go.mem.heap_objects`: Number of allocated heap objects

* `process.runtime.go.mem.heap_released`: Bytes of idle spans whose physical memory has been returned to the OS

* **process.runtime.go.mem.heap\_sys**: Bytes of heap memory obtained from the OS

* `process.runtime.go.mem.live_objects`: Number of live objects is the number of cumulative Mallocs - Frees

* `process.runtime.go.gc.count`: Number of completed garbage collection cycles

* `process.runtime.go.goroutines.count`: Number of goroutines that currently exist

* `process.runtime.go.info`: Information about the Go runtime environment e.g. Go version

If you don't need runtime metrics, you can disable them in the config:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash config.yaml
  telemetry:
    metrics:
      router_runtime: false
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Dimensions

All metrics are tracked along different dimensions. A dimension is an attribute in Open Telemetry or a label in Prometheus.

#### Common and known environment dimensions across all metrics

* `wg.federated_graph.id`: The ID of the running graph

* `wg.router.version`: The current router binary version

* `wg.router.config.version`: The current router config version

#### Common GraphQL dimensions across all metrics

* `wg.operation.protocol`: The used protocol `http` , `ws`

* `wg.operation.name`: The name of the operation

* `wg.operation.type`: The type of the operation e.g. `query`

* `wg.client.name`: The client name

* `wg.client.version`: The client version

**Error identification**

You can use the `router.http.requests.error`  ****metric to track errors across router and subgraph requests. In addition to that, you can also use the `router.http.requests`  ****metric to identify errors. We attach the following fields:

* `wg.request.error`: Identify if an error occurred. This applies to a request that didn't result in a successful HTTP or GraphQL response. Only set when it is `true`. Be aware that a Status-Code `200` can still be an error in GraphQL.

* `http.status_code`: The status code of the response.

You have two ways to query for errors. Both metrics can be quite useful depending on the query scenario. In general, we recommend to use the `router.http.requests.error` metric.

#### Subgraph specific

* `wg.subgraph.name`: The name of the subgraph

* `wg.subgraph.id`: The ID of the subgraph

### Resource attributes

In OTEL, resource attributes are special attributes, identifying metrics based on resource characteristics. Although stored differently, they affect metric cardinality. In Prometheus, this data is labeled on the `target_info` metric.

* `service.name`: The name of the router. Can be configured through the `telemetry.service_name` option.

* `service.version`: The version of the router binary.

* `service.instance.id`: The unique instance ID of the router. Can be configured through the `instance_id`option.

* `process.pid`: The id of the running process

* `host.name`: The hostname of the machine where the router is running.

* `telemetry.sdk.version`: The version of instrumentation library.

* `telemetry.sdk.language`: The programming language of the instrumented application.

Few attributes can configured through the route configuration:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash config.yaml
  instance_id: my_replica_1 # Unique instance ID e.g. replica-1
  cluster:
    name: us-central1-cosmo-cloud
  telemetry:
    service_name: my-application # Name of your application e.g. my-router
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Please use meaningful names in the Studio to ensure clarity. The instance ID is particularly important because it allows for the identification of a router even after restarts. If not specified, a random unique ID is used.

## Custom Attributes

You can also add custom attributes to OTEL and Prometheus. Please refer to the [Custom Attributes](/router/open-telemetry/global-custom-attributes) section.

## Subgraph errors

When the router sends a request to your subgraphs and encounters a failure, we capture each subgraph error as individual OpenTelemetry (OTEL) events associated with the `Engine - Fetch` Span. These events include details such as the subgraph name, ID, error message, and extension code (if available). Additionally, we increment the `router.http.requests.error` metric.

## Prometheus

To get a list of all Prometheus metrics, we advise navigating to the Prometheus endpoint [http://127.0.0.1:8088/metrics](http://127.0.0.1:8088/metrics). However, it's important to initiate a request first; failing to do so will result in no request metrics being displayed.

### Exclude certain metrics and labels

Sometimes it is useful to have the flexibility to exclude specific metrics or labels to reduce the load "cardinality" of your metrics server. You can do this easily by excluding them in the router config. We support a Go Regex string. You can test your Regex at [https://regex101.com/](https://regex101.com/).

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash config.yaml
  telemetry:
    # OpenTelemetry Metrics
    metrics:
      # Expose OpenTelemetry metrics as Prometheus metrics
      prometheus:
        exclude_metrics:
          - "^router_http_request_duration_milliseconds$" # Exclude the full histogram
        exclude_metric_labels:
          - "^wg_client_version$"
  ```
</CodeGroup>

This excludes `router_http_request_duration_milliseconds` histogram and the label `wg_client_version` from all metrics.

<Info>
  Default process and Go metrics can't be excluded. If you haven't run a query against the router yet, you'll see no `router_* `metrics because no metrics have been generated.
</Info>

### Exclude scope info

You can exclude OpenTelemetry scope info from Prometheus labels as well, which can be useful in some cases where you want to reduce metrics cardinality.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash config.yaml
  telemetry:
    # OpenTelemetry Metrics
    metrics:
      # Expose OpenTelemetry metrics as Prometheus metrics
      prometheus:
        exclude_scope_info: true
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Make metrics accessible on all networks

In container environments, it is necessary to expose your server on `0.0.0.0` to make the port accessible from outside.You can enable it by setting the following configuration.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash config.yaml
  telemetry:
    metrics:
      prometheus:
        listen_addr: "0.0.0.0:8088"
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Alternatively, you can use the environment variable.

```
PROMETHEUS_LISTEN_ADDR=0.0.0.0:8088
```

### Example Prometheus Queries

Here you can see a few example queries to query useful information about your client traffic:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Router">
    The router is the API Gateway. Every client request counts as an individual request.

    #### Get request rate by operation name

    ```
    sum by (wg_operation_name) (rate(router_http_requests_total{wg_subgraph_name="",wg_operation_name!=""}[5m]))
    ```

    #### Get error rate by operation name

    ```
    sum by (wg_operation_name) (rate(router_http_requests_error_total{wg_subgraph_name="",wg_operation_name!=""}[5m]))
    ```

    #### 95th percentile latency by operation name

    ```
    histogram_quantile(0.95, sum by (wg_operation_name, le) (rate(router_http_request_duration
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Subgraph">
    A GraphQL query can result in multiple requests to your subgraphs. Every request is annotated with the subgraph name and id.

    #### Get request rate by operation name

    ```
    sum by (wg_operation_name) (rate(router_http_requests_total{wg_subgraph_name!="",wg_operation_name!=""}[5m]))
    ```

    #### Get error rate by operation name

    ```
    sum by (wg_operation_name) (rate(router_http_requests_error_total{wg_subgraph_name!="",wg_operation_name!=""}[5m]))
    ```

    #### 95th percentile latency by operation name

    ```
    histogram_quantile(0.95, sum by (wg_operation_name, le) (rate(router_http_request_duration_milliseconds_bucket{wg_subgraph_id!=""}[5m])))
    ```

    #### Get error rate by subgraph name

    ```
    sum by (wg_subgraph_name, le) (rate(router_http_requests_error_total[5m]))
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Summary

By collecting the metrics, you can find answers to the following questions:

* What is the error/success rate of my router/subgraph or a specific operation?

* How is the performance of my router/subgraph or a specific operation?

* What is the average request/response size of a specific operation?

* How much traffic went through a router/subgraph instance?

* What's the distribution of Queries / Mutations and Subscription requests?

* What's the resource utilization in terms of CPU / Memory of my router instance?

* What're the Go runtime information of my router instance?
