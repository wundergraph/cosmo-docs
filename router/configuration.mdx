The router provides three different ways of customization:

1. **Configure the router runtime:** You can specify a [`config.yaml`](/router/configuration#config-file) for convenience or pass [environment variables](/router/configuration#environment-variables). In both ways, you can configure the global behavior of the router. For a full reference of all available options see below or use your [IDE of choice](/router/configuration#config-validation-and-auto-completion).

2. **Configure how your graph is served:** This file can be provided as config option or is pulled automatically from the cdn. It contains information on how to resolve your federated schema. The engine uses the information to build a highly optimized query planner. For more information see [`wgc router compose`](/cli/router/compose) to build the file locally for development or [`wgc router fetch`](/cli/router/fetch) to download the latest production version.

3. **Customize the router programatically through** Go [modules](/router/custom-modules). It is unlikely that we will provide every possible feature as an in-built functionality. For advanced use cases or more control, you can build Go modules and compile the Router in a few commands. If you are uncertain about if your use case should be implemented as a custom module, don't hesitate to open an issue. We might already have a plan for this or can assist you with the implementation.

<Info>
  **Recommendation** Create a config file and use environment variable expansion to avoid storing secrets on the file system.
</Info>

## Config file

For convenience, you can create a `config.yaml` to specify all router options. Start the router in the same directory or pass the path to the file as a `CONFIG_PATH` environment variable.

<CodeGroup>
  ```yaml config.yaml
  version: '1'

  graph:
      token: "${GRAPH_API_TOKEN}"
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  Values specified in the config file have **precedence** over Environment variables. This also includes empty values so only specify values that should be overwritten. That means, you can see the config file as a single source of truth.
</Note>

### Expand Environment Variables

You can expand environment variables in the file like this:

<CodeGroup>
  ```yaml config.yaml
  version: '1'

  log_level: "${LOG_LEVEL}"
  ```
</CodeGroup>

This will replace the value of the environment variable `LOG_LEVEL` with the value of the key `log_level` in your config file. For numeric values, ensure quotes are omitted.

### Config Validation & Auto-completion

We know configuration is hard, especially for a software component like the router that can be customized entirely to your needs. In order to simplify this, we use [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/) to validate the router configuration. This comes with huge benefits, all right at your fingertips:

* Auto-completion

* Documentation (Usage, Examples)

* Detect deprecated fields

* Detect typos or invalid values.

Some options require the router to validate them. This requires starting the router. Once your router has started successfully, you can be sure that your configuration is valid.

### IDE Configuration

* **VsCode**: Install the [YAML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml) extension in your IDE.

* **JetBrains**: Support out of the box but in some circumstances it conflicts with other default mappings. **Go to** `Languages & Frameworks` -> `Schemas and DTDs` -> `JSON Schemas Mappings` configure the mapping yourself.

As the next step, add the following line to the head of your `config.yaml`file. This line informs your IDE, to download the correct JSON schema file to validate the config file.

<CodeGroup>
  ```yaml config.yaml
  # yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wundergraph/cosmo/main/router/pkg/config/config.schema.json

  version: '1'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

If you want to pin to a specific router version use the following URL:

<CodeGroup>
  ```yaml config.yaml
  # yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wundergraph/cosmo/router%400.67.0/router/pkg/config/config.schema.json
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Now, you should get auto-completion <Icon icon="star" />.

## Environment Variables

Many configuration options can be set as environment variables. For a complete list of options, please look at the [Router](/router/configuration#router) config tables.

## Router

The following sections describe each configuration in detail with all available options and their defaults.

<Info>
  Intervals, timeouts, and delays are specified in Go [duration](https://pkg.go.dev/maze.io/x/duration#ParseDuration) syntax e.g 1s, 5m or 1h.

  Sizes can be specified in 2MB, 1mib.

  version: "1"

  cache_control_policy:
    enabled: true
    value: "max-age=180, public"
    subgraphs:
      - name: "products"
        value: "max-age=60, public"
      - name: "pricing"
        value: "no-cache"
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Custom Modules

Configure your custom Modules. More information on this feature can be found here: [Custom Modules](/router/custom-modules)

Example YAML config:

<CodeGroup>
  ```yaml config.yaml
  version: "1"

  modules:
    myModule:
      # Arbitrary values, unmarshalled by the module
      value: 1
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Headers

Configure Header propagation rules for all Subgraphs or individual Subgraphs by name.

### Cookie Whitelist

When `Cookie`is a propagated header, you may want to filter the keys that are forwarded to the subgraph from the client, you can do this via the `cookie_whitelist`option, which is a list of string cookie keys that will not be discarded. An empty value means allow all. If you'd like to block all cookies, disable the header propagation entirely.

<Info>
  The cookie whitelist can also affect custom modules that read request cookies, even if propagation is disabled for the `Cookie` header. This is because the whitelisting happens very early in the request lifecycle, before it reaches subgraphs or custom modules.
</Info>

**Example YAML config:**

```bash
version: "1"

# Header manipulation
# See "https://cosmo-docs.wundergraph.com/router/proxy-capabilities" for more info
headers:
  cookie_whitelist:
   - "authorization"
   - "my-cookie-key"
  all:
    request:
      - op: "propagate"
        named: Cookie
```

### Global Header Rules

Apply to requests/responses to/from "all" Subgraphs. These will be applied globally in the graph

| Environment Variable | YAML | Required | Description |Default Value|
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | request | <Icon icon="square" /> | List of Request Header Rules |  |
|  | response | <Icon icon="square" /> | List of Response Header Rules |  |


### Example YAML config:

<CodeGroup>
  ```yaml config.yaml
  version: "1"

  # Header manipulation
  # See "https://cosmo-docs.wundergraph.com/router/proxy-capabilities" for more info
  headers:
    all: # Header rules for all origin requests.
      request:
        - op: "propagate"
          named: X-Test-Header
        - op: "propagate"
          matching: (?i)^x-deprecated-.*
        - op: "set"
          name: "X-API-Key"
          value: "my-secret-value"
      response:
        - op: "propagate"
          algorithm: "append"
          named: "X-Custom-Header"
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Request Header Rule

Apply to requests to specific Subgraphs.

| Environment Variable | YAML | Required | Description |Default Value|
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | op | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  /> | oneof=propagate, set |  |
|  | matching | <Icon icon="square" /> | matching is the regex to match the header name against |  |

|  | value | <Icon icon="square" /> | If `op` is `set`, `value` is the value of the desired header to set |  |

### Example YAML config:

<CodeGroup>
  ```yaml config.yaml
  version: "1"

  # Header manipulation
  # See "https://cosmo-docs.wundergraph.com/router/proxy-capabilities" for more information
  headers:
    subgraphs:

        request:
          - op: "propagate"
            named: X-Test-Header
          - op: "set"
            name: "X-API-Key"
            value: "my-secret-value"
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Response Header Rule

These rules can be applied to all responses, as well as just to specific subgraphs, and used to manipulate and propagate response headers from subgraphs to the client. By configuring the rule, users can define how headers should be handled when multiple subgraphs provide conflicting values for a specific header.

| Environment Variable | YAML | Required | Description |Default Value|
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | op | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  /> | oneof=propagate, set |  |

|  | matching | <Icon icon="square" /> | matching is the regex to match the header name against. This |  |
|  | named | <Icon icon="square" /> | named is the exact header name to match |  |
|  | default | <Icon icon="square" /> | default is the default value to set if the header is not present |  |
|  | rename | <Icon icon="square" /> | renames the header's key to the provided value |  |

### Example YAML config:

<CodeGroup>
  ```yaml config.yaml
  version: "1"

  # Header manipulation
  # See "https://cosmo-docs.wundergraph.com/router/proxy-capabilities" for more information
  headers:
    subgraphs:
      product: # Header rules for the "product" Subgraph
        response:
          - op: "propagate"
            algorithm: "append"
            named: "X-Test-Header"
          - op: "propagate"
            algorithm: "last_write"
            named: "X-Test2-Header"
          - op: "set"
            name: "X-User-Key"
            value: "my-user-value"
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Storage Providers

The configuration for the storage providers. Storage providers can be used to store the persisted operations and the execution config.

### Example YAML config:

```yaml
version: "1"

storage_providers:
  cdn:
    - url: https://cosmo-cdn.wundergraph.com
      id: cdn
  s3:
    - id: "s3"
      endpoint: "localhost:10000"
      bucket: "cosmo"
      access_key: "key"
      secret_key: "secret"
      region: us-east-1
      secure: false
  redis:
    - id: "my-redis"
      cluster_enabled: false
      urls:
        - "redis://localhost:6379"
```

<Info>
Users can supply a list of URLs for their redis storage provider.

* If `cluster_enabled: false` , then we will use the first URL for the connection URL.

* If `cluster_enabled: true` , then we will use all of the URLs for the [Redis Cluster](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/management/scaling/) connection.

URLs can be supplied with redis configuration options embedded, such as: `redis://myUser:myPass@localhost:6379?ssl=true&db=1@connectTimeout=2`

</Info>

<Note>
  Prior to [router@v0.169.0](https://github.com/wundergraph/cosmo/releases/tag/router%400.168.1), the redis configuration looks like:

```
  redis:
    - id: "my_redis"
      url: "redis://localhost:6379"
```
</Note>

### Storage Provider Yaml Options

These rules apply to requests being made from the Router to all Subgraphs.

|  |s3.secure| <Icon icon="square" /> | Enables https in the provided endpoint. Must be set to `false` when accessing http endpoints | true |

## Persisted Operations

The configuration for the persisted operations allows you to maintain a fixed set of GraphQL operations that can be queried against the router without exposing your entire graph to the public. This approach enhances security and performance.

### Example YAML config:

<CodeGroup>
  ```yaml config.yaml
  version: "1"

  persisted_operations:
  log_unknown: false
  safelist:
    enabled: false
  cache:
    size: 100MB
  storage:
    provider_id: s3
    object_prefix: wundergraph
```
</CodeGroup>
### Persisted Operations Configuration Options

These rules apply to requests being made from the Router to all Subgraphs.

|Environment Variable|YAML|Required|Description|Default Value|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|  | persisted\_operations | <Icon icon="square" /> | The configuration for the persisted operations. |  |
|  | persisted\_operations.cache | <Icon icon="square" /> | LRU cache for persisted operations. |  |
| PERSISTED_OPERATIONS_CACHE_SIZE  | persisted\_operations.cache.size | <Icon icon="square" /> | The size of the cache in SI unit. | "100MB" |
|  | persisted\_operations.storage | <Icon icon="square" /> | The storage provider for persisted operation. Only one provider can be active. When no provider is specified, the router will fallback to the Cosmo CDN provider to download the persisted operations. |  |
| PERSISTED_OPERATIONS_STORAGE_PROVIDER_ID | persisted\_operations.storage.provider\_id | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  /> | The ID of the storage provider. The ID must match the ID of the storage provider in the `storage_providers` section. |  |
| PERSISTED_OPERATIONS_STORAGE_OBJECT_PREFIX | persisted\_operations.storage.object\_prefix | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  /> | The prefix of the object in the storage provider location. The prefix is put in front of the operation SHA256 hash. $prefix/SHA256.json |  |
| PERSISTED_OPERATIONS_LOG_UNKNOWN | persisted\_operations.log\_unknown | <Icon icon="square" /> | Log operations (sent with the operation body) which haven't yet been persisted. If the value is true, all operations not yet persisted are logged to the router logs. | false |
| PERSISTED_OPERATIONS_SAFELIST_ENABLED | persisted\_operations.safelist.enabled | <Icon icon="square" /> | Only allows persisted operations (sent with operation body). If the value is true, all operations not explicitly added to the safelist are blocked. | false |

## Automatic Persisted Queries

The configuration for automatic persisted queries allows you to enable automated caching of select GraphQL operations that can be queried against the router, using both POST and GET requests. This approach enhances performance.

It defaults to using a local cache (with the size defined in `cache.size`), but users can optionally use a Redis storage

### Example YAML config:

<CodeGroup>
  ```yaml config.yaml
  version: "1"

  automatic_persisted_queries:
  enabled: true
  cache:
    size: 10MB # This is only relevant for an in-memory cache that we maintain
    ttl: 900 # in seconds, set both for a local and a remote KV
  storage:
    provider_id: "my_redis"
    object_prefix: cosmo_apq
```
</CodeGroup>
### Configuration Options

These rules apply to requests being made from the Router to all Subgraphs.

|Environment Variable|YAML|Required|Description|Default Value|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|  | automatic\_persisted\_queries | <Icon icon="square" /> | The configuration for the persisted operations. |  |
|  | automatic\_persisted\_queries.enabled | <Icon icon="square" /> | Whether or not automatic persisted queries is enabled | true |
|  | automatic\_persisted\_queries.cache | <Icon icon="square" /> | LRU cache for persisted operations. |  |

|  | automatic\_persisted\_queries.cache.ttl | <Icon icon="square" /> | The TTL of the cache, in seconds. Set to 0 to set no TTL |  |
|  | automatic\_persisted\_queries.storage | <Icon icon="square" /> | The external storage provider (redis) for automatic persisted operation. Only one provider can be active. When no provider is specified, the router will fallback to using a local in-memory cache (configured in the `automatic_persisted_queries.cache` options) |  |
|  | automatic\_persisted\_queries.storage.provider\_id | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  /> | The ID of the Redis storage provider. The ID must match the ID of the storage provider in the `storage_providers.redis` section. |  |
|  | automatic\_persisted\_queries.storage.object\_prefix | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  /> | The prefix of the object in the storage provider location. The prefix is put in front of the operation SHA256 hash. $prefix/SHA256 |  |

## Execution Config

The configuration for the execution setup contains instructions for the router to plan and execute your GraphQL operations. You can specify the storage provider from which the configuration should be fetched.

### Example YAML config:

<CodeGroup>
  ```yaml config.yaml
  version: "1"

  execution_config:
  storage:
    provider_id: s3
    object_path: /prod
```
</CodeGroup>

|  |max\_conns\_per\_host| <Icon icon="square" /> |  | 100 |
|  |max\_idle\_conns\_per\_host| <Icon icon="square" /> |  | 20 |

### Jitter Retry

|Environment Variable|YAML|Required|Description|Default Value|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|RETRY\_ENABLED |enabled| <Icon icon="square" /> |  | true |
|  |algorithm| <Icon icon="square" /> | backoff_jitter | backoff\_jitter |
|  |max\_attempts| <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  /> |  |  |
|  |max\_duration| <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  /> |  |  |
|  | interval | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  /> |  |  |


### Client Request Request Rules

These rules apply to requests being made from clients to the Router.

|Environment Variable|YAML|Required|Description|Default Value|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|  |max\_request\_body\_size| <Icon icon="square" /> | | 5mb |
|MAX\_HEADER\_BYTES |max\_header\_bytes| <Icon icon="square"/> | Minimum Router version: [0.156.0](https://github.com/wundergraph/cosmo/compare/router@0.155.0...router@0.156.0) <br/> The maximum size of the request headers. Setting this to 0 uses the default value from the http standard lib, which is 1MiB. |1mib|
|  |decompression\_enabled| <Icon icon="square" /> |When enabled, the router will check incoming requests for a 'Content-Encoding' header and decompress the body accordingly<br/>Note: Currently only "gzip" is supported  | true |
5mb

## WebSocket

Configure WebSocket handlers, protocols, and more.

### WebSocket Configuration

|Environment Variable|YAML|Required|Description|Default Value|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|WEBSOCKETS\_ENABLED |enabled| <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  /> |  | true |
| |absinthe\_protocol | <Icon icon="square" /> |[Absinthe Protocol Configuration](/router/configuration#absinthe-protocol-configuration)|  |
|  |forward\_upgrade\_headers | <Icon icon="square" /> |Forward all useful Headers from the Upgrade Request, like User-Agent or Authorization in the extensions field when subscribing on a Subgraph|  |
|  |forward\_upgrade\_query\_params | <Icon icon="square" /> |Forward all query parameters from the Upgrade Request in the extensions field when subscribing on a Subgraph|  |
|  |forward\_initial\_payload | <Icon icon="square" /> |Forward the initial payload from a client subscription in the extensions field when subscribing on a Subgraph| true |

### Absinthe Protocol Configuration

Legacy WebSocket clients that use the Absinthe protocol might not be able to send a Subprotocol Header. For such clients, you can use the Absinthe Endpoint which automatically chooses the Subprotocol for them so that no Subprotocol Header needs to be set.

|Environment Variable|YAML|Required|Description|Default Value|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|WEBSOCKETS\_ABSINTHE\_ENABLED |enabled| <Icon icon="square" /> |  | true |
| WEBSOCKETS_ABSINTHE_HANDLER_PATH |handler\_path | <Icon icon="square" /> |The path to mount the Absinthe handler on| /absinthe/socket |


### WebSocket Authentication

It's possible that Authentication for a WebSocket connection is not possible at the HTTP layer. In such a case, you can enable Authentication "from\_initial\_payload". This will extract a value from the "initial\_payload" field in the first WebSocket message which is responsible for negotiating the protocol between client and server.

In addition, it's possible to export the extracted value into a Request Header, which allows the Router to propagate it using [Header Propagation Rules](/router/configuration#global-header-rules) in subsequent Subgraph Requests.

### Example WebSocket YAML config:

<CodeGroup>
  ```yaml config.yaml
  version: "1"

  websocket:
    enabled: true
    absinthe_protocol:
      enabled: true
      handler_path: /absinthe/socket
    forward_initial_payload: true
    forward_upgrade_headers:
      enabled: true
      allow_list: # an empty list allows all headers
        - "Authorization" # forward only the Authorization Header
    forward_upgrade_query_params:
      enabled: true
      allow_list:
        - "Authorization"
    authentication:
      # enable authentication from the initial payload
      from_initial_payload:
        enabled: false
        # which key to use one the initial payload to "extract" the Authorization value
        key: "authorization"
        export_token:
          export_token: false
          # to enable Subgraph authentication, we can export the value into a Header
          header_key: "Authorization"
  ```
</CodeGroup>

|ENGINE\_ENABLE\_REQUEST\_TRACING|enable\_request\_tracing| <Icon icon="square" /> |Enable [Advanced Request Tracing (ART)](/router/advanced-request-tracing-art)This config is not correlated to OTEL tracing. | true |
|ENGINE\_ENABLE\_EXECUTION\_PLAN\_CACHE\_RESPONSE\_HEADER|enable\_execution\_plan\_cache\_response\_header| <Icon icon="square" /> |Usually only required for testing. When enabled, the Router sets the response Header "X-WG-Execution-Plan-Cache" to "HIT" or "MISS" | false |
|ENGINE\_MAX\_CONCURRENT\_RESOLVERS|max\_concurrent\_resolvers| <Icon icon="square" /> |Use this to limit the concurrency in the GraphQL Engine. A high number will lead to more memory usage. A number too low will slow down your Router. | 32 |
|ENGINE\_ENABLE\_NET\_POLL|enable\_net\_poll| <Icon icon="square" /> |Enables the more efficient poll implementation for all WebSocket implementations (client, server) of the router. This is only available on Linux and MacOS. On Windows or when the host system is limited, the default synchronous implementation is used. | true |

## Rate Limiting

Configures a rate limiter on the outgoing subgraphs requests. When enabled, a rate of 10 req/s with a burst of 10 requests is configured.

<Info>
  The rate limiter requires Redis version 3.2 or newer since it relies on [replicate\_commands](https://redis.io/commands/eval#replicating-commands-instead-of-scripts) feature. ElastiCache for Redis only works in non-clustered mode. You can enable a failover instance to achieve high availability.
</Info>

### Key Suffix Expression

As you can see in the config table below, you can define an expression to generate the a rate limiting key suffix. The evaluation of the expression must return a string, which will be appended to the key prefix.

Using a key suffix expression, you're able to dynamically choose a rate limiting key, e.g. based on the user authentication, a header, or a combination. Here's an example expression that uses the `sub` claim if available, and a Header as the fallback.

```bash
request.auth.claims.sub ?? request.header.Get('X-Forwarded-For')
```

For mor information on how to use the expression language, please refer to the [Template Expressions](/router/configuration/template-expressions)section.

## Subgraph Error Propagation

The configuration for the subgraph error propagation. Errors can be exposed to the client in a "wrapped" form to hide Subgraph internals, or it's possible to "pass-through" Subgraph errors directly to the client.

| Environment Variable | YAML | Required | Description | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SUBGRAPH_ERROR_PROPAGATION_ENABLED | enabled | <Icon icon="square" /> | Enable error propagation. If the value is true (default: false), Subgraph errors will be propagated to the client. | false |
| SUBGRAPH_ERROR_PROPAGATION_MODE | mode | <Icon icon="square" /> | The mode of error propagation. The supported modes are 'wrapped' (default) and 'pass-through'. The 'wrapped' mode wraps the error in a custom error object to hide internals. The 'pass-through' mode returns the error as is from the Subgraph. | wrapped |
| SUBGRAPH_ERROR_PROPAGATION_REWRITE_PATHS | rewrite_paths | <Icon icon="square" /> | Rewrite the paths of the Subgraph errors. If the value is true (default), the paths of the Subgraph errors will be rewritten to match the Schema of the Federated Graph. | true |
| SUBGRAPH_ERROR_PROPAGATION_OMIT_LOCATIONS | omit_locations | <Icon icon="square" /> | Omit the location field of Subgraph errors. If the value is true, the location field of Subgraph errors will be omitted. This is useful because the locations of a Subgraph error is internal to the Subgraph and not relevant to the client. | true |
| SUBGRAPH_ERROR_PROPAGATION_OMIT_EXTENSIONS | omit_extensions | <Icon icon="square" /> | Omit the extensions field of Subgraph errors. If the value is true, the extensions field of Subgraph errors will be omitted. This is useful in case you want to avoid leaking internal information to the client. Some users of GraphQL leverage the errors.extensions.code field to implement error handling logic in the client, in which case you might want to set this to false. | false |
| SUBGRAPH_ERROR_PROPAGATION_STATUS_CODES | propagate_status_codes | <Icon icon="square" /> | Propagate Subgraph status codes. If the value is true, Subgraph Response status codes will be propagated to the client in the errors.extensions.code field. | false |
| SUBGRAPH_ERROR_PROPAGATION_ALLOWED_FIELDS | allowed_fields | <Icon icon="square" /> | In passthrough mode, by default only message and path is propagated. You can specify additional fields here. | |
| SUBGRAPH_ERROR_PROPAGATION_DEFAULT_EXTENSION_CODE | default_extension_code | <Icon icon="square" /> | The default extension code. The default extension code is used to specify the default code for the Subgraph errors when the code is not present. | DOWNSTREAM_SERVICE_ERROR |
| SUBGRAPH_ERROR_PROPAGATION_ATTACH_SERVICE_NAME | attach_service_name | <Icon icon="square" /> | Attach the service name to each Subgraph error. If the value is true, the service name will be attached to the Subgraph errors. | true |
| SUBGRAPH_ERROR_PROPAGATION_ALLOWED_EXTENSION_FIELDS | allowed_extension_fields | <Icon icon="square" /> | The allowed extension fields. The allowed extension fields are used to specify which fields of the Subgraph errors are allowed to be propagated to the client. | ["code"] |

### Example YAML configuration:

```yaml
version: "1"

subgraph_error_propagation:
    enabled: true
    propagate_status_codes: false
    mode: "wrapped"
    rewrite_paths: true
    omit_locations: true
    omit_extensions: false
    default_extension_code: DOWNSTREAM_SERVICE_ERROR
    attach_service_name: true
    allowed_extension_fields:
      - "code"
```

## Security

The configuration for the security. The security is used to configure the security settings for the Router.

| Environment Variable | YAML | Required | Description | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SECURITY_BLOCK_MUTATIONS | block_mutations | <Icon icon="square" /> | Block mutation Operations. | |
| SECURITY_BLOCK_MUTATIONS_ENABLED | block_mutations.enabled | <Icon icon="square" /> | If the value is true, the mutations are blocked. | false |
| SECURITY_BLOCK_MUTATIONS_CONDITION | block_mutations.condition | <Icon icon="square" /> | The [expression](/router/configuration/template-expressions#authentication-object) to evaluate if the operation should be blocked. | |
| SECURITY_BLOCK_SUBSCRIPTIONS | block_subscriptions | <Icon icon="square" /> | Block subscription Operations. | |
|  | block_subscriptions.enabled | <Icon icon="square" /> | If the value is true, the subscriptions are blocked. | false |
|  | block_subscriptions.condition | <Icon icon="square" /> | The [expression](/router/configuration/template-expressions) to evaluate if the operation should be blocked. | |
| SECURITY_BLOCK_NON_PERSISTED_OPERATIONS | block_non_persisted_operations | <Icon icon="square" /> | Block non-persisted Operations. | |
| SECURITY_BLOCK_NON_PERSISTED_OPERATIONS_ENABLED | block_non_persisted_operations.enabled | <Icon icon="square" /> | If the value is true, the non-persisted operations are blocked. | false |
| SECURITY_BLOCK_NON_PERSISTED_OPERATIONS_CONDITION | block_non_persisted_operations.condition | <Icon icon="square" /> | The [expression](/router/configuration/template-expressions) to evaluate if the operation should be blocked. | |
|  | complexity_calculation_cache | <Icon icon="square" /> | Complexity Cache configuration | |
|  | complexity_limits | <Icon icon="square" /> | Complexity limits configuration | |

### Example YAML Configuration

```yaml
version: "1"

security:
    block_mutations:
      enabled: false
      condition: "request.header.Get('x-block-mutation') == 'yes'"
    block_subscriptions:
      enabled: false
    block_non_persisted_operations:
      enabled: false
    complexity_calculation_cache: # This is for a local in-memory cache, to persist the calculation results
      enabled: true
      size: 1024
    complexity_limits:
        depth: # the equivalent of `security.depth_limit` prevoiusly
          enabled: true
          limit: 7
          ignore_persisted_operations: true
        total_fields:
          enabled: true
          limit: 128
          ignore_persisted_operations: true
        root_fields:
          enabled: true
          limit: 3
          ignore_persisted_operations: true
        root_field_aliases:
          enabled: false
          limit: 3
          ignore_persisted_operations: true
```

<Warning>
  Query Depth is now deprecated. We recommend using the `security.complexity_calculation_cache` and `security.complexity_limits` configurations instead, which provide that functionality.
</Warning>

### Complexity Calculation Cache

The configuration for the in-memory complexity cache, to help speed up the calculation process in the event of a recurring query

| Environment Variable | YAML | Required | Description | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SECURITY\_COMPLEXITY\_CACHE\_ENABLED | enabled | <Icon icon="square" /> | Enable the complexity cache | false |
| SECURITY\_COMPLEXITY\_CACHE\_SIZE | size | <Icon icon="square" /> | The size of the complexity cache | 1024 |


### Complexity Limits

The configuration for adding a complexity limits for queries. We currently expose 4 limits:

* **Query Depth** - How many nested levels you can have in a query. This limit prevents infinite querying, and also limits the size of the data returned.

* **Total Fields in Query**

* **Root Fields in Query**

* **Root Field Aliases in Query**

For all of the limits, if the limit is 0, or `enabled` isn't true, the limit isn't applied. All of them have the same configuration fields:

| Environment Variable | YAML | Required | Description | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | enabled | <Icon icon="square" /> | Enable the specific limit. If the value is true (default: false), and a valid limit value is set, the limit will be applied | false |
|  | limit | <Icon icon="square" /> | The limit amount for query. If the limit is 0, this limit isn't applied | 0 |
|  | ignore_persisted_operations | <Icon icon="square" /> | Disable the limit for persisted operations. Since persisted operations are stored intentionally, users may want to disable the limit to consciously allow nested persisted operations | false |


## File Upload

The configuration for file upload. Configure whether it should be enabled along with file size and number of files.

| Environment Variable | YAML | Required | Description | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FILE\_UPLOAD\_ENABLED | enabled | <Icon icon="square" /> | Whether the feature is enabled or not | true |
| FILE\_UPLOAD\_MAX\_FILE\_SIZE | max\_file\_size | <Icon icon="square" /> | The maximum size of a file that can be uploaded. The size is specified as a string with a number and a unit, e.g. 10KB, 1MB, 1GB. The supported units are 'KB', 'MB', 'GB'. | 50MB |
| FILE\_UPLOAD\_MAX\_FILES | max\_files | <Icon icon="square" /> | The maximum number of files that can be uploaded per request. | 2 |

### Example YAML Configuration

```yaml
version: "1"

file_upload:
    enabled: true
    max_file_size: 1GB
    max_files: 2
```

## Client Header

The configuration for custom names for client name and client version headers.

| Environment Variable | YAML | Required | Description | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | name | <Icon icon="square" /> | The custom name of the client name header. | |
|  | version | <Icon icon="square" /> | The custom name of the client version header. | |


### Example YAML Configuration

```yaml
version: "1"

client_header:
  name: "Client-Name"
  version: "Client-Version"
```

By default, we support `Graphql-Client-Name` , `Graphql-Client-Version`, `Apollo-Graphql-Client-Name`, `Apollo-Graphql-Client-Version`.

The custom names are given more precedence.

## Apollo Compatibility Flags

This configuration is used to enable full compatibility with Apollo Federation, Apollo Gateway and Apollo Router, you can enable certain compatibility flags, allowing you to use Cosmo Router as a drop-in replacement for Apollo.

### Apollo Compatibility Value Completion

Invalid \_\_typename values will be returned in extensions.valueCompletion instead of errors.

### Apollo Compatibility Truncate Floats

Truncate floats like 1.0 to 1, 2.0 to 2, etc.. Values like 1.1 or 2.2 will not be truncated.

### Apollo Compatibility Suppress Fetch Errors

Suppresses fetch errors. When enabled, only the 'data' object is returned, suppressing errors. If disabled, fetch errors are included in the 'errors' array.

### Apollo Compatibility Replace Undefined Op Field Errors

Produces the same error message as Apollo when an invalid operation field is included in an operation selection set. **Extension code**: "GRAPHQL\_VALIDATION\_FAILED" Status code: 400

### Apollo Compatibility Replace Invalid Var Errors

Produces the same error message as Apollo when an invalid variable is supplied. **Extension code**: "BAD\_USER\_INPUT"

### Apollo Compatibility Replace Validation Error Status

Produces the same error status as Apollo when validation fails. **Error status**: 400 Bad Request **Minimum router version**: [0.175.0](https://github.com/wundergraph/cosmo/compare/router@0.174.3...router@0.175.0)

| APOLLO_COMPATIBILITY_SUBSCRIPTION_MULTIPART_PRINT_BOUNDARY_ENABLED | subscription_multipart_print_boundary: enabled: \<bool> | <Icon icon="square" /> | Prints the multipart boundary right after the message in multipart subscriptions. Without this flag, the Apollo client wouldn't parse a message until the next one is pushed. | false |

### Example YAML Configuration

```yaml
version: "1"

apollo_compatibility_flags:
    enable_all: false
    value_completion:
        enabled: true

    replace_validation_error_status:
        enabled: false
```

## Apollo Router Compatibility Flags

<Info>
  Apollo Router Compatibility Flags *can* be enabled alongside Apollo Compatibility Flags, but some will override their counterpart's functionality. This means you can safely use `enable_all: true` alongside these flags.
</Info>

### Apollo Router Compatibility Replace Invalid Var Errors

Produces the same error messages as Apollo Router when an invalid variable is supplied.

Extension code: "VALIDATION_INVALID_TYPE_VARIABLE"

| Environment Variable | YAML | Required | Description | Default Value |
