## Subgraph timeouts

Although the router comes with good defaults, you can change the timeouts according to your needs. For example, if you need to operate with very slow upstream services, you can increase `request_timeout`, which defines the maximum amount of time a request can take. Zero means no limit.

```yaml
traffic_shaping:
  # Rules are applied to all subgraph requests.
  all:
    # Subgraph transport options
    request_timeout: 60s
    dial_timeout: 30s
    keep_alive_idle_timeout: 0s
    keep_alive_probe_interval: 30s
    tls_handshake_timeout: 10s
    response_header_timeout: 0s
    expect_continue_timeout: 0s
  subgraphs: # allows you to create subgraph specific traffic shaping rules
    products: # Will only affect this subgraph and override the default settings
      request_timeout: 60s
      dial_timeout: 30s
      keep_alive_idle_timeout: 0s
      keep_alive_probe_interval:
      tls_handshake_timeout: 10s
      response_header_timeout: 0s
      expect_continue_timeout: 0s
```

* `request_timeout`: The maximum amount of time a request can take. The timeout includes connection time, any redirects, and reading the response body.

* `dial_timeout`: The maximum amount of time a dial will wait for a connect to complete

* `keep_alive_idle_timeout`: The maximum amount of time an idle (keep-alive) connection will remain idle before closing itself.

* `keep_alive_probe_interval`: Specifies the interval between keep-alive probes for an active network connection.

* `tls_handshake_timeout`: Specifies the maximum amount of time waiting to wait for a TLS handshake.

* `response_header_timeout`: If non-zero, specifies the amount of time to wait for a server's response headers after fully writing the request (including its body, if any).

* `expect_continue_timeout`: If non-zero, specifies the amount of time to wait for a server's first response headers after fully writing the request headers if the request has an "Expect: 100-continue" header.
