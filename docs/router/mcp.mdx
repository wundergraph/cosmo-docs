## What is MCP?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a protocol designed to help AI models interact with your APIs by providing context, schema information, and a standardized interface. The Cosmo Router implements an MCP server that exposes your GraphQL operations as tools that AI models can use.

<Info>
  MCP enables AI models to understand and interact with your GraphQL API without
  requiring custom integration code for each model.
</Info>

The Cosmo MCP Server builds on top of the concept of persisted operations (also known as persisted queries or trusted documents). Instead of allowing AI models to execute arbitrary GraphQL operations, it exposes a predefined set of validated and approved operations. This provides a secure and controlled way for AI systems to interact with your data while maintaining tight control over what operations can be executed.

## Why Use GraphQL with MCP?

The integration of GraphQL with MCP creates a uniquely powerful system for AI-API interactions:

- **Precise data selection**: GraphQL's nature allows you to define exactly what data AI models can access, from simple queries to complex operations across your entire graph.
- **Declarative operation definition**: Create purpose-built `.graphql` files with operations tailored specifically for AI consumption. These function as persisted operations (trusted documents), giving you complete control over what queries AI models can execute.
- **Flexible data exposure**: Control exactly which operations and fields are exposed to AI systems with granular precision.
- **Compositional API design**: Build different operation sets for different AI use cases without changing your underlying API.
- **Runtime safety**: GraphQL's strong typing ensures AI models can only request valid data patterns that match your schema.
- **Built-in validation**: Operation validation prevents malformed queries from ever reaching your backend systems.
- **Evolve without breaking**: Change your underlying data model while maintaining stable AI-facing operations.
- **Federation-ready**: Works seamlessly with federated GraphQL schemas, giving AI access to data across your entire organization.

But what does this mean in practice? How do these technical benefits translate to real-world solutions? To truly understand the transformative power of GraphQL with MCP, let's explore a common scenario that organizations face when integrating AI with their existing systems.

## Real-World Example: AI Integration in Finance

A large financial services company needed to integrate AI assistants into their support workflow—but faced a critical problem: how to allow access to transaction data without exposing sensitive financial details or breaching compliance.

<Info>
  Without proper data boundaries, AI models might inadvertently access or expose
  sensitive customer information, creating security and compliance risks.
</Info>

Their existing REST APIs posed three major challenges:

1. **Security vulnerabilities**: Their existing REST endpoints contained mixed sensitive and non-sensitive data, making them unusable for AI integration without major restructuring.

2. **Development bottlenecks**: Their engineering team estimated 6+ months to create and maintain a parallel "AI-safe" REST API, delaying their AI initiative significantly.

3. **Data governance issues**: Without granular control, they couldn't meet regulatory requirements for tracking and limiting what data AI systems could access.

### Using GraphQL and MCP to Define a Safe Access Layer

The team adopted GraphQL with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to expose only specific operations tailored for AI access:

```graphql
# AI-safe transaction query with PII and financial details removed
query GetTransactionHistory($accountId: ID!, $last: Int!) {
  account(id: $accountId) {
    transactions(last: $last) {
      id
      date
      merchantNameMasked
      category
      amount
      status
      # No account numbers, routing information, location data, or full merchant details
    }
  }
}
```

This allowed the company to:

- Accelerate compliance review by clearly showing what data AI could access
- Avoid duplicating APIs, using GraphQL’s type system and persisted operations
- Enforce operational boundaries through schema validation and mutation exclusion
- Scale safely by exposing new fields to AI only when explicitly approved

With this model in place, AI assistants could answer questions like “Did my payment to Amazon go through?” using only the approved fields and without touching full account numbers, balance history, or other restricted data.

### Outcome
This approach helped the company:

- Achieve compliance sign-off in weeks instead of months
- Reduce security review effort by 95%
- Maintain a single source of truth for internal and AI clients
- Future-proof their integration as the API evolved

By combining GraphQL and MCP, they enabled a secure, flexible interface for AI models without having to rewrite their backend.

## How It Works

The Cosmo Router server:

1. Loads GraphQL operations from a specified directory
2. Validates them against your schema
3. Generates JSON schemas for operation variables
4. Exposes these operations as tools that AI models can discover and use
5. Handles execution of operations when called by AI models

When an AI model interacts with your MCP endpoint:

1. It discovers available GraphQL operations
2. Understands input requirements through the JSON schema
3. Executes operations with appropriate parameters
4. Receives structured data that it can interpret and use in its responses

## Built-in MCP Tools

The MCP server provides several tools out of the box to help AI models discover and interact with your GraphQL API:

### Discovery Tools

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="get_operation_info" icon="circle-info">
    Retrieves detailed information about a specific GraphQL operation, including
    its input schema, query structure, and execution guidance. AI models use
    this to understand how to properly call an operation in real-world
    scenarios.
  </Card>
  <Card title="get_schema" icon="code">
    Provides the full GraphQL schema as a string. This helps AI models
    understand the entire API structure. This tool is only available if
    `expose_schema` is enabled.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Execution Tools

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="execute_graphql" icon="play">
    Executes arbitrary GraphQL queries or mutations against your API. This tool is only available if `enable_arbitrary_operations` is enabled, allowing AI models to craft and execute custom operations beyond predefined ones.
  </Card>
  <Card title="execute_operation_*" icon="rocket">
    For each GraphQL operation in your operations directory, the MCP server automatically generates a corresponding execution tool with the pattern `execute_operation_<operation_name>` (e.g., `execute_operation_get_users`).
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Tool Naming and Schema Generation

The operation execution tools provide a structured and controlled way for AI models to interact with your API:

- **Tool naming**: Tools follow the pattern `execute_operation_<operation_name>` (with operation names converted to snake_case)
- **Tool schema**: Generated from your GraphQL operation's variables, ensuring type safety
- **Tool description**: Inherited from your GraphQL operation descriptions, including operation name and additional context
- **Mutation warnings**: Tools for mutation operations include a warning that the operation has side effects

By default, all operations in your specified directory will be exposed as tools. Use the `exclude_mutations: true` configuration option to prevent mutation operations from being exposed if you want to ensure AI models can only read data.

## Configuration

To enable MCP in your Cosmo Router, add the following configuration to your `config.yaml`:

```yaml
mcp:
  enabled: true
  server:
    listen_addr: "localhost:5025"
  router_url: "https://your-public-router-url.example.com/graphql" # Optional: Use when router is behind a proxy
  storage:
    provider_id: "mcp" # References a file_system provider defined below
  graph_name: "my-graph"
  exclude_mutations: true
  enable_arbitrary_operations: false
  expose_schema: false

# Configure storage providers
storage_providers:
  file_system:
    - id: "mcp"
      path: "operations" # Relative to the router binary
```

## Storage Providers

MCP loads operations from a configured file system storage provider. This allows you to centralize the configuration of operation sources:

```yaml
storage_providers:
  file_system:
    - id: "mcp"
      path: "operations" # Relative to the router binary
```

Then reference this storage provider in your MCP configuration:

```yaml
mcp:
  storage:
    provider_id: "mcp"
```

A storage provider must be specified to load GraphQL operations.

## Setting Up Operations

1. Create a directory to store your GraphQL operations as specified in your `storage.provider_id` configuration.
2. Add `.graphql` files containing named GraphQL operations.

Each operation file should contain a single named operation along with a description comment that AI models can use to understand its purpose.

### Example Query Operation

Create a file `operations/getUsers.graphql`:

```graphql
# Returns a list of all users in the system with their basic information
# This is a read-only operation that doesn't modify any data
query GetUsers {
  users {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}
```

### Example Mutation Operation

Create a file `operations/createUser.graphql`:

```graphql
# Creates a new user in the system
# Required inputs: name and email
mutation CreateUser($name: String!, $email: String!) {
  createUser(input: { name: $name, email: $email }) {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}
```

### Directory Structure

Here's an example of how your project directory might be structured:

```
my-router-project/
├── config.yaml                 # Router configuration file
├── operations/                 # Operations directory (as configured in storage provider)
│   ├── getUsers.graphql        # Query operation
│   ├── createUser.graphql      # Mutation operation
│   ├── getUserById.graphql     # Query with parameters
└── ...
```

The important points:

- The path in your `storage_providers.file_system.path` should point to the operations directory
- All `.graphql` files in this directory (and subdirectories) will be loaded
- Each file should contain a single named GraphQL operation

### Operation Naming and Tool Generation

The MCP server converts each operation into a corresponding tool:

- Operation name: `GetUsers` → Tool name: `execute_operation_get_users`
- Operation name: `CreateUser` → Tool name: `execute_operation_create_user`

Operations are converted to snake_case for tool naming consistency.

### Best Practices

1. **Meaningful names**: Give operations clear, action-oriented names that describe what they do.
2. **Add descriptions**: Include comments that describe the operation's purpose, required inputs, and any side effects.
3. **Use explicit types**: Define all input variables with explicit types to ensure proper validation.
4. **Create focused operations**: Design operations specifically for AI model consumption rather than exposing generic operations.
5. **Security considerations**: For mutation operations, add checks and validations to prevent misuse.

## Authentication

The MCP server respects the "Authorization" header from MCP clients and forwards them to the router. This allows you to leverage all the authentication and authorization capabilities of your Cosmo Router when AI models interact with your GraphQL API.

<Info>
  By passing authentication headers from AI tools to your GraphQL API, you can
  maintain consistent security across all API consumers while giving AI models
  appropriate access to your data.
</Info>

### Configuration

The authentication header can be configured in various AI tools and environments:

#### Cursor and Claude Desktop

Configure Cursor and Claude Desktop to use your MCP server with authentication by using the `mcp-remote` command.

<Note>
  Cursor and Claude Desktop (Windows) have a bug where spaces inside args aren't
  escaped when it invokes npx, which ends up mangling these values. You can work
  around it by interpolating the value into the command using the `env` key.
</Note>

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mygraph": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "mcp-remote",
        "http://localhost:5025/mcp",
        "--header",
        "Authorization:${AUTH_HEADER}" // note no spaces around ':'
      ],
      "env": {
        "AUTH_HEADER": "Bearer <your-api-key>" // spaces OK in env vars
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### VS Code

In VS Code, you can configure the MCP extension with authentication headers in your `settings.json`:

```json
"mcp": {
  "servers": {
    "mygraph": {
      "type": "sse",
      "url": "http://localhost:5025/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Other MCP-compatible Tools

Other tools and AI models that support the MCP protocol typically provide similar ways to configure authentication headers. Always check the documentation for your specific AI tool for the exact configuration syntax.
