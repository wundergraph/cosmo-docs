The Cosmo Router can be easily extended by providing custom modules. Modules are pure Go code and can implement one or multiple interfaces. The following interfaces are provided:

- `core.RouterOnRequestHandler` Implements a custom middleware that runs before most internal middleware in the router for each client request. Most importantly this is called before tracing and authentication logic for each request. **Use case:** Custom Authentication Logic, Custom Tracing Logic, Early return, Request Validation.
- `core.RouterMiddlewareHandler` Implements a custom middleware on the router. The middleware is called for every client request. It allows you to modify the request before it is processed by the GraphQL engine. **Use case:** Logging, Caching, Early return, Request Validation, Header manipulation.
- `core.EnginePreOriginHandler` Implements a custom handler that is executed before the request is sent to the subgraph. This handler is called for every subgraph request. **Use case:** Logging, Header manipulation.
- `core.EnginePostOriginHandler` Implement a custom handler executed after the request to the subgraph but before the response is passed to the GraphQL engine. This handler is called for every subgraph response. **Use cases:** Logging, Caching.
- `core.Provisioner` Implements a Module lifecycle hook that is executed when the module is instantiated. Use it to prepare your module and validate the configuration.
- `core.Cleaner` Implements a Module lifecycle hook that is executed after the server is shutdown. Use it to close connections gracefully or for any other cleanup.
- `core.SubscriptionOnStartHandler` Implements a custom handler that is executed before a subscription is started. It allows you to verify if the client is allowed to start the subscription and also send initial data to the subscription. **Use cases:** send an initial message to the client, custom subscription authorization logics

<Info>
  `*OriginHandler` handlers are called concurrently when your GraphQL operation
  results in multiple subgraph requests. Due to that circumstance, you should
  handle the initial router request/response objects `ctx.Request()` and
  `ctx.ResponseWriter()` as read-only objects. Any modification without
  protecting them from concurrent writes, e.g., by a mutex, results in a race
  condition.
</Info>

<Info>
  `RouterOnRequestHander` is only available since Router [0.188.0](https://github.com/wundergraph/cosmo/releases/tag/router%400.188.0)

  `SubscriptionOnStartHandler` is only available since Router [0.X.X](https://github.com/wundergraph/cosmo/releases/tag/router%400.X.X)
</Info>

The example below shows how to implement a custom middleware that has access to the GraphQL operation information.

```go
package module

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"github.com/wundergraph/cosmo/router/core"
	"net/http"
)

func init() {
	// Register your module here and it will be loaded at router start
	core.RegisterModule(&MyModule{})
}

type MyModule struct {}

func (m *MyModule) Middleware(ctx core.RequestContext, next http.Handler) {

	operation := ctx.Operation()

	// Access the GraphQL operation context
	fmt.Println(
		operation.Name(),
		operation.Type(),
		operation.Hash(),
		operation.Content(),
	)

	// Call the next handler in the chain or
	// return early by calling ctx.ResponseWriter().Write()
	next.ServeHTTP(ctx.ResponseWriter(), ctx.Request())
}

func (m *MyModule) Module() core.ModuleInfo {
	return core.ModuleInfo{
		// This is the ID of your module, it must be unique
		ID: "myModule",
		// The priority of your module, lower the number higher the priority
		// Value should be > 0
		Priority: 1,
		New: func() app.Module {
			return MyModule{}
		},
	}
}

// Interface guards
// In words: My Module has to implement the following interfaces
// otherwise it will not compile
var (
	_ core.RouterMiddlewareHandler = (*MyModule)(nil)
)
```

## Priority Loading of Modules

When loading multiple modules, the order is not inherently guaranteed. To ensure a specific loading order, you can use the `Priority` option. Modules with lower priority numbers are loaded first. Below is an example configuration:

```go
core.ModuleInfo{
	// This is the ID of your module, it must be unique
	ID: "myModule",
	// The priority of your module, lower the number higher the priority
	// Value should be > 0
	Priority: 1,
	New: func() app.Module {
		return MyModule{}
	},
}
```

In this example, the module `myModule` has a priority of 1, meaning it will be loaded before modules with higher priority values.

## Access the GraphQL operation

During the client request, you have access to the actual GraphQL operation. Simply call:

```go
// ctx core.RequestContext

operation := ctx.Operation()
c.Name() // MyOperation
c.Type() // Query
c.OperationHash() // 81671788718
c.Content() // query MyOperation { ... }
```

## Access query plan information

In Middleware, you can access some stats about the query plan that will be used for the operation.

```go
func (m *MyModule) Middleware(ctx core.RequestContext, next http.Handler) {
	qps, err := ctx.Operation().QueryPlanStats()
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	fmt.Printf("subgraphs contacted: %v\n", qps.SubgraphFetches)
	fmt.Printf("total subgraphs contacted: %d\n", qps.TotalSubgraphFetches)

	// Call the next handler in the chain or return early by calling w.Write()
	next.ServeHTTP(ctx.ResponseWriter(), ctx.Request())
}
```

QueryPlanStats includes the following info:

- Total count of subgraph fetches
- A map of subgraph names to the number of times they will be fetched

Middleware is executed before any of the fetches are made, so you can use this information as a heuristic cost for rate limiting, etc.

## Access Request Context

In every handler, you can add/remove, or modify response headers. We also provide a convenient, safe way to share data across handlers.

```go
// ctx core.RequestContext

// Sets a custom header on the final response
ctx.ResponseWriter().Header().Set("myHeader", c.GetString("myKey"))

// Provides access to the request logger
ctx.Logger().Info("My log line")

// Sets a value on the context. Use c.GetString to access the underlying value
// in any other handler you want
ctx.Set("myKey", "myValue")
```

## Access Subgraph through Request Context

Through the request context you can retrieve the active subgraph for the current request. This can be done in the OnOriginRequest hook as show below

```go
func (m MyModule) OnOriginRequest(request *http.Request, ctx core.RequestContext) (*http.Request, *http.Response) {
	subgraph := ctx.ActiveSubgraph(request)
	subgraph.Name // Subgraph name
	subgraph.Id   // Subgraph ID from the controlplane
	subgraph.Url  // Stored subgraph URL from the router config
}
```

  https://github.com/wundergraph/cosmo/tree/main/router/cmd/custom
</Info>

## Access authentication information

Authentication information, including claims and the provider that authenticated the request, can be accessed through `core.RequestContext.Authentication()`

<Info>
  For a full example, please check out
  https://github.com/wundergraph/cosmo/tree/main/router/cmd/custom-jwt
</Info>

## Change Authentication Information

Above, we showed how to access Authentication information. There can be cases where your authentication could depend partly on another system, and you want to set elements for use with other directives, such as [@requiresScopes](/federation/directives/requiresscopes). In order to do that, you can use `auth.SetScopes()` to manually change the authentication's scopes.

```go
func (m *SetScopesModule) Middleware(ctx core.RequestContext, next http.Handler) {
	auth := ctx.Authentication()
	if auth != nil {
		// You can set the scopes for a request, based on an
		// external system, and then utilize that for the @requiresScope
		// directive
		auth.SetScopes([]string{"read:employee"})
	}
	next.ServeHTTP(ctx.ResponseWriter(), ctx.Request())
}
```

`.SetScopes()` overwrites the existing scopes. If you'd like to append/preserve the built-in scopes, you can first use `auth.Claims()` to get the existing scopes, and incorporate that into the updates scopes.

```go
func (m *SetScopesModule) Middleware(ctx core.RequestContext, next http.Handler) {
	auth := ctx.Authentication()
	if auth != nil {
		claims := auth.Claims()
		existingScopes := claims["scopes"].(string)
		scopesSlice := strings.Split(existingScopes, " ")
		updatedScopes := append(scopesSlice, m.Scopes...)
		auth.SetScopes(updatedScopes)
	}

	next.ServeHTTP(ctx.ResponseWriter(), ctx.Request())
}
```

If you have to set the authentication scopes, but the authentication could be not set, you can call the method `ctx.SetAuthenticationScopes(scopes []string)` that, if the Authentication is not set, it will initialize it with an empty object and set the scopes. If the authentication is already set, it will just override the scopes.

```go
func (m *SetScopesModule) Middleware(core.RequestContext, next http.Handler) {
	// Initialize the scopes
	customScopes := []string{"scope1", "scope2"}

	// Set the authentication scopes
	ctx.SetAuthenticationScopes(customScopes)

	next.ServeHTTP(ctx.ResponseWriter(), ctx.Request())
}
```

The scopes will be available to subsequent custom modules, just like when using `SetScopes()`.

### Do Changes Before Authentication Occurs

In the previous section, the `Middleware` runs after the authentication of the request. However, sometimes you might want to run authentication related logic before the authentication actually happens. For example, let's say that your client sends the `Authorization` header without the `Bearer` part in the header and you want to add `Bearer` to the header, for this you can use the `RouterOnRequestHandler` hook.

```go
func (m *SetScopesModule) RouterOnRequest(ctx core.RequestContext, next http.Handler) {
    authHeader := ctx.Request().Header.Get("Authorization")

    if authHeader != "" && !strings.HasPrefix(strings.ToLower(authHeader), "bearer ") {
       ctx.Request().Header.Set("Authorization", "Bearer "+authHeader)
    }

    next.ServeHTTP(ctx.ResponseWriter(), ctx.Request())
}
```

## Send an initial message in the subscription

When a subscription is started you could need to send an initial message to the client, even if nothing is coming from the subgraph or edfs provider. In these cases you can implement a `SubscriptionOnStartHandler` .

Lets say that you have a GraphQL subgraph that defines the following subscription:

```graphql
type Subscription {
	matchScore(matchId: Int!): Score! @edfs__kafkaSubscribe(topics: ["scores"], providerId: "my-kafka")
}
```

When a client subscribes to the `matchScore` subscription, it will receive the score as soon as a message is published on the `scores` topic.
But if the first message is coming late, the subscribed client could remain without data for a long time.
To improve the user experience you could send an initial message to the client when the subscription is started, calling an external service
to get the initial score.

```go
func (m *InitialMsgModule) SubscriptionOnStart(ctx core.SubscriptionOnStartHookContext) {
    // Check if the subscription is the one you want to handle
    if ctx.SubscriptionEventConfiguration().RootFieldName() != "matchScore" {
        return
    }

    // Get the matchId from the subscription
    matchId := ctx.Operation().Variables().GetInt("matchId")

    // Call the external service to get the initial score
    scores, err := m.getInitialScore(matchId)
    if err != nil {
        return
    }

    // Send the initial score to the client
    // The message should follow the same schema of other messages sent in the topic
    ctx.WriteEvent(&kafka.Event{
        Data: []byte(fmt.Sprintf(`{"teamAName": %s, "teamBName": %s, "teamAScore": %d, "teamBScore": %d, "_typename": "Score"}`, scores.TeamAName, scores.TeamBName, scores.TeamAScore, scores.TeamBScore)),
    })
}
```


## Stop subscription if the client has not the right claim

You might like to have additional permissions check to decide if a client is allowed to subscribe to a subscription.
In these cases you can implement a `SubscriptionOnStartHandler` to check the permissions and stop the subscription if the
client has not the right permissions.

Lets say that you have a GraphQL subgraph that defines the following subscription:

```graphql
type Subscription {
	matchScore(matchId: Int!): Score!
}
```

When a client subscribes to the `matchScore` subscription, and if the client has not the right claim, the subscription
will not be started and the client will receive an error.

```go
func (m *StopSubscriptionModule) SubscriptionOnStart(ctx core.SubscriptionOnStartHookContext) {
    rootFieldName := ctx.SubscriptionEventConfiguration().RootFieldName()
    if rootFieldName != "matchScore" {
      return nil
    }
    auths := ctx.Authentication()
    if auths == nil {
      return core.NewStreamHookError(
        errors.New("client does not have authentication set"), 
        "client does not have authentication set",
        http.StatusUnauthorized, 
        http.StatusText(http.StatusUnauthorized),
      )
    }
    // Get the claims from the authentication
    claims := auths.Claims()
    if val, ok := claims["can_subscribe"]; !ok || val != "true" {
      return core.NewStreamHookError(
        errors.New("client does not have the right claim"), 
        "client does not have the right claim",
        http.StatusUnauthorized, 
        http.StatusText(http.StatusUnauthorized),
      )
    }

    return nil
}
```

## Return GraphQL conform errors

Please always use `core.WriteResponseError` to return an error. It ensures that the request is properly tracked for tracing and metrics.

```go
func (m *MyModule) Middleware(ctx core.RequestContext, next http.Handler) {
    // Exit early
    core.WriteResponseError(ctx, fmt.Errorf("my custom error: %w", err))
    // or pass on
    next.ServeHTTP(ctx.ResponseWriter(), ctx.Request())
}
```

## Request Handler lifecycle

The current module handler allow to intercept and modify request / response subgraphs.

```
Incoming client request
    │
    └─▶ core.RouterOnRequestHandler (Early return, Custom Authentication Logic)
    │
    └─▶ core.RouterMiddlewareHandler (Early return, Validation)
       │
       └─▶ "If the request starts a subscription"
          │
          └─▶ core.SubscriptionOnStartHandler (Early return, Custom Authentication Logic)
       │
       └─▶ core.EnginePreOriginHandler (Header mods, Custom Response, Caching)
       │
       └─▶ "Request to the subgraph"
       │
       └─▶ core.EnginePostOriginHandler (Logging, Response mods)
       │
       └─▶ "Fulfill subgraph response"
```

## Module Configuration

If you need to pass external configuration values to your module, you can do so easily by annotating the fields in your module struct. Fields must start with an uppercase letter to make them accessible.

```go
const myModuleID = "myModule"

type MyModule struct {
	// Properties that are set by the config file are automatically populated based on the `mapstructure` tag
	// Create a new section under `modules.<name>` in the config file with the same name as your module.
	// Don't forget in Go the first letter of a property must be uppercase to be exported

	Value uint64 `mapstructure:"value"`

	Logger *zap.Logger
}
```

### Example Config file

Based on the example above we will populate the field `Value` with the value `1`. You can also validate your config in the `core.Provisioner` handler.

```bash config.yaml
version: '1'

modules:
  myModule: # Id of your module
    Value: 1
```

## Development

Due to the circumstance that modules are pure Go code, we can leverage all tooling. If you have VSCode or Goland you can easily debug and profile your code. Let's make it running locally first:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Clone _the_ [Cosmo Repository](https://github.com/wundergraph/cosmo). Ensure
    you checkout on the latest [router
    tag](https://github.com/wundergraph/cosmo/tags).
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Navigate to the router
    [directory](https://github.com/wundergraph/cosmo/tree/main/router)
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Run `go run cmd/custom/main.go` to start your router or use your IDE to
    start the debug mode.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Open http://localhost:3002 to test your module
    code.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Build your own Router Image

We provide a dockerfile that can be used to build a production-grade docker image from your custom router. Run the following command in the router [directory](https://github.com/wundergraph/cosmo/tree/main/router).

```bash
docker build -f custom.Dockerfile -t router-custom:latest .
```

In order to start your router run:

```bash
docker run \
  --name custom-cosmo-router \
  --rm \
  -p 3002:3002 \
  --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
  -e DEV_MODE=true \
  -e LISTEN_ADDR=0.0.0.0:3002 \
  -e GRAPH_API_TOKEN=<graph-api-token> \
  docker.io/library/router-custom:latest
```

### Versioning

Please ensure that you checkout on an official [router tag](https://github.com/wundergraph/cosmo/tags) when extending the router, and only upgrade if necessary. This way, you can avoid any surprises. For every release, we provide detailed release notes that should provide you with a good overview of whether an upgrade is worthwhile.

<Info>
  Please inform us if you have more advanced use cases that cannot be
  accommodated with the current feature set.
</Info>

### Future Plans

We're currently working on the iteration of the module system. It will allow you to fully customize the router with a complete overhaul of the development experience. The new module system will be available in the next major release of the router. If you have any questions or suggestions, please reach out to us on the [GitHub](https://github.com/wundergraph/cosmo/pull/1063) RFC.
