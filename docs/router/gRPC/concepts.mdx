## Introduction

The Cosmo Router supports integration with gRPC through a schema-first approach. You define a GraphQL schema that represents the interface to your gRPC implementation, and the Cosmo tooling generates the corresponding Protocol Buffer definitions and mappings that enable the router to establish communication.

This approach allows you to bridge any service - whether it's gRPC, REST, SOAP, or legacy systems - into your GraphQL Federation Supergraph by creating a protocol translation layer. The router handles the communication with your implementations based on the generated mappings, making it easy to modernize your architecture while preserving existing investments.


## What is gRPC?

gRPC is a modern, open-source, high-performance RPC framework that enables communication between services using a lightweight binary protocol. It provides a robust foundation for building distributed systems and is widely adopted in the industry.

Key characteristics include:
* **Language and platform agnostic** - allows you to define service interfaces in a language-neutral way
* **Protocol Buffers** - uses protobuf as the interface definition language for type-safe communication
* **High performance** - binary protocol enables efficient data serialization and transmission
* **Industry standard** - widely adopted across microservices architectures

You can find more information about gRPC [here](https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/introduction/).

## What is gRPC Integration in Cosmo?

gRPC integration in Cosmo allows you to incorporate gRPC-based functionality into your GraphQL Federation through a code generation workflow:

- **Schema-driven integration** where you define GraphQL schemas that represent your gRPC interfaces
- **Automatic protobuf generation** from your GraphQL schema definitions
- **Router-managed communication** where the Cosmo Router handles gRPC communication
- **Protocol translation** between GraphQL requests and gRPC calls
- **Type-safe mappings** ensuring consistency between GraphQL and protobuf definitions
- **Flexible deployment models** supporting both local and remote gRPC implementations

## Core Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define GraphQL Schema">
    Create a GraphQL schema that represents the interface to your gRPC implementation. This schema defines the types, queries, mutations, and inputs that will be exposed through your GraphQL API.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate Protobuf Files">
    Use the Cosmo CLI to automatically generate protobuf service definitions and mapping configurations from your GraphQL schema. This creates the bridge between GraphQL and gRPC protocols.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Implement gRPC Logic">
    Build your gRPC implementation using the generated protobuf definitions. This implements the business logic for your GraphQL operations.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Router">
    Configure the Cosmo Router to understand how to communicate with your gRPC implementation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy and Test">
    Deploy your setup and test the integration by making GraphQL queries that are translated to gRPC calls.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Motivation

Many companies see the value of GraphQL Federation but are hesitant to adopt it because they have existing systems that are incompatible, like legacy systems, REST APIs, SOAP, etc.

gRPC integration solves this problem by making it easy to generate adapters between your Supergraph and existing systems. The system is designed with modern development tools in mind - define a GraphQL schema, provide an OpenAPI document, a SOAP WSDL, or even just some curl commands, and AI coding assistants can generate adapter code and tests in minutes.

Thanks to the strongly-typed proto definition and built-in tooling, development becomes faster and more reliable.

## Core Benefits

<CardGroup cols={2}>
    <Card title="Simplify GraphQL Implementation" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
        While everyone understands the value of "one schema, one query," building and maintaining production-grade subgraphs across diverse environments remains challenging. Spec support, runtime performance, and type safety depend on your implementation quality.
    </Card>

    <Card title="Design with GraphQL, Implement with gRPC" icon="code">
        Our approach combines GraphQL's schema-first flexibility with gRPC's performance and type safety. You can develop implementations in any language that supports gRPC while maintaining GraphQL's benefits.
    </Card>

    <Card title="Proto-Based Code Generation" icon="bolt">
        The strict typing and automatic code generation from Protocol Buffers (proto) definitions provides an immense productivity boost, especially in the era of generative AI. The generated proto-based gRPC code creates a strongly-typed foundation that AI tools can effectively understand and extend.
    </Card>

    <Card title="Strongly-Typed Integration" icon="shield-check">
        With gRPC integration, there's no way to get around the proto definition. If the implementation compiles against the proto definition, you know it's correct. This eliminates a whole class of integration issues.
    </Card>

    <Card title="Apollo Federation Compatibility" icon="merge">
        gRPC implementations are 100% compatible with existing Apollo Federation Subgraph implementations. You can use gRPC alongside existing subgraphs seamlessly.
    </Card>

    <Card title="No N+1 Problems" icon="layer-group">
        gRPC implementations leverage Cosmo Router's DataLoader capabilities which batch requests by default, avoiding common performance pitfalls.
    </Card>

    <Card title="No Framework Lag" icon="chevrons-right">
        When new features are added to the GraphQL Federation specification, gRPC implementations can immediately take advantage of them since federation logic is handled within the Router.
    </Card>
    <Card title="LLM-Friendly" icon="robot">
        gRPC integration is a great fit for LLM-based applications. From a generated proto definition, an LLM can generate a gRPC service implementation in any supported language.

## Benefits Over Traditional REST Integration

When compared to integrating REST APIs into GraphQL Federation, gRPC offers several advantages:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
    <Card title="Efficient Communication" icon="bolt">
        Binary protocol and HTTP/2 multiplexing provide better performance than traditional REST over HTTP/1.1, especially for high-frequency communication.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Automatic Code Generation" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
        Generate protobuf definitions and mappings directly from your GraphQL schema, reducing development time and ensuring consistency.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Streaming Support" icon="water">
        Native support for streaming data enables real-time capabilities and efficient handling of large datasets.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Contract-First Development" icon="file-contract">
        GraphQL schemas serve as the single source of truth for service contracts, with protobuf definitions generated automatically to ensure compatibility.
    </Card>

<Warning>
    Streaming support is currently not yet supported for gRPC services in the router.

## Architecture Overview

gRPC integration into GraphQL Federation follows this pattern:

1. **Schema Definition**: You define GraphQL schemas that represent your gRPC interfaces
2. **Code Generation**: Cosmo tooling generates protobuf definitions and mappings from your GraphQL schemas
3. **Router Configuration**: The router is configured with the generated mappings to understand how to communicate with your gRPC implementations
4. **Request Processing**: When GraphQL queries are received, the router translates relevant portions into gRPC calls
5. **Protocol Translation**: The router handles the translation between GraphQL and gRPC protocols
6. **Response Assembly**: Results from gRPC calls are translated back to GraphQL and assembled into the final response

## Implementation Options

Cosmo provides two main approaches for gRPC integration:

### gRPC Plugins
- **Local execution**: Run as separate processes managed by the router
- **Simplified deployment**: Deployed alongside the router
- **Lower latency**: Direct inter-process communication
- **Currently Go-only**: Implementation language is limited to Go

### gRPC Services  
- **Remote execution**: Run as independent services anywhere in your infrastructure
- **Language flexibility**: Implement in any language that supports gRPC
- **Independent scaling**: Scale services based on their specific requirements
- **Distributed architecture**: Services can be deployed across different environments

## Limitations
