## Overview

This page outlines the supported features and known limitations for the gRPC integration (both plugins and services) with the Cosmo Router. Development is in progress to expand support and address these limitations.
## Feature Support Overview

The following table lists each gRPC integration feature, its current status, and a brief description.

| **Nested Lists** | ✅ | Multi-dimensional arrays |
| **Complex List Structures** | ✅ | Lists of objects and interfaces |
| **Nullable List Items** | ❌ | Not supported due to Protobuf constraints |
| **Entity Definitions** | ✅ | Standard federation entities |
| **Key Directives** | ✅ | Single and compound keys |
| **External Fields** | ✅ | Cross-service field references |
| **Field Resolvers** | ✅ | Custom field resolution supported with batching capabilities |
| **GraphQL Subscriptions** | ❌ | Real-time data subscriptions not yet supported |

## 🔄 Roadmap

## Schema Linting

When designing your GraphQL schema, you might encounter some of the limitations mentioned above. To ensure compatibility with the Cosmo Router's gRPC integration, we provide schema linting through protographic that validates your GraphQL schema against gRPC compatibility requirements.

### How Linting Works

The linting process analyzes your GraphQL schema and identifies potential compatibility issues with gRPC:

- **Warnings**: Non-breaking issues that highlight features that may not work as expected
- **Errors**: Breaking issues that prevent successful gRPC integration and must be fixed

### Warnings vs Errors

#### Warnings
Warnings allow the generation process to complete but inform you about potential limitations:

- **Process continues**: The protobuf generation will finish successfully
- **Feature limitations**: Highlights GraphQL features that may not be fully supported in gRPC
- **Non-breaking**: Your plugin will still function, but certain features may behave differently

**Example Warning**: Using nullable list items like `[String]!` will generate a warning since this pattern isn't directly supported in protobuf.

#### Errors
Errors halt the generation process and require immediate attention:

- **Process stops**: The protobuf generation will fail and must be resolved
- **Breaking issues**: Indicates schema patterns that cannot be translated to gRPC
- **Must be fixed**: You need to modify your schema before proceeding

**Example Error**: Using unsupported GraphQL features that have no protobuf equivalent.

### Linting Output

When you run the generation command, you'll see output similar to:

```bash
[!] Schema validation warnings:
 │

```

### Feature Gates

Some linting rules are controlled by feature gates and may evolve over time:

- **Experimental features**: Some rules may be relaxed as gRPC integration capabilities expand
- **Backward compatibility**: Existing linting behavior is maintained for stability
- **Future improvements**: Rules may be removed or modified as new features become available

<Info>
**Tip**: Pay attention to warnings during development. While they don't prevent your plugin from working, they help you understand which GraphQL features may have limitations in the gRPC context.
</Info>

### Best Practices

1. **Address errors first**: Fix all linting errors before proceeding with development
2. **Review warnings carefully**: Understand the implications of warnings for your use case
3. **Test thoroughly**: When warnings are present, test the affected functionality carefully
4. **Stay updated**: Check for updates to linting rules as the gRPC integration evolves

### Common Linting Issues

| Issue | Type | Description | Resolution |
|-------|------|-------------|------------|
| Nullable list items `[String]!` | Warning | Not directly supported in protobuf | Consider alternative patterns |
| Custom scalars | Warning | Limited to fixed mappings | Use built-in scalars or string types |
| Union types | Error | Not supported in current integration | Refactor to use interfaces or separate types |
| Complex nested inputs | Warning | May have performance implications | Consider flattening input structures |
