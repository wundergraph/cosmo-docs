Golang is one of the languages supported out of the box for developing router plugins. It comes with its own `router-plugin` library that provides certain features out of the box. The `router-plugin` package we provide internally uses the official Hashicorp `go-plugin` plugin server helper functions.

This section goes into detail of the features provided, documentation can also be found [here](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/wundergraph/cosmo/router-plugin).
