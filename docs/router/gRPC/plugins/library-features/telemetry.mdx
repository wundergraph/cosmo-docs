## Tracing

The router provides built-in tracing support that extends to your plugins. This allows you to trace operations from the router through to your plugin code.

To enable tracing in your plugin, use the `WithTracing()` option when initializing:

```go
routerplugin.WithTracing()
```

Here's how to configure it during plugin initialization:

```go
pl, err := routerplugin.NewRouterPlugin(
	func(s *grpc.Server) {
		s.RegisterService(&projects.ProjectsService_ServiceDesc, &service.ProjectsService{
			NextID: 1,
		})
	},
	routerplugin.WithTracing(),
)
```

### How tracing works

When your plugin starts up, the router shares its telemetry configuration with the plugin. This configuration includes crucial trace context such as the `traceparent` value.

When you enable tracing in your plugin using `WithTracing()`, the plugin uses this shared configuration to set up its own tracing. This ensures that any operations performed by your plugin become part of the same distributed trace that originated from the router.

Additionally, when your plugin makes HTTP requests using the provided HTTP client, the trace context is automatically propagated to downstream services. This creates an unbroken chain of tracing that spans from the initial router request, through your plugin, and into any external APIs you call.

### Working with traces

Under the hood we use the opentelemetry-go library, which means the same can be used to work with traces. More information can be found in the [otel go docs](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/go/). A few examples are as follows.

#### Create a new trace
```go
tracer := otel.Tracer("inner-tracer")
ctx, span := tracer.Start(ctx, customSpanName)
span.SetAttributes(
    customKey,
    customValue,
)
defer span.End()
```

#### Add attributes to the current trace
```go
span := trace.SpanFromContext(ctx)
span.SetAttributes(
    semconv.HTTPClientIPKey.String("127.2.2.5"),
)
```

### HTTP Client Traces

If you are utilizing the provided inbuilt HTTP Client, you can also get out of the box tracing with it. Read [this section](/router/gRPC/plugins/library-features/http-client#inbuilt-tracing) for more information.
