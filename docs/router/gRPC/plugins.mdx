## Introduction

Router plugins are extensions that run as separate processes locally alongside the Cosmo Router and communicate over Google's Remote Procedure Call ([gRPC](https://grpc.io/)) protocol. Unlike gRPC services that run remotely over the network, plugins provide the simplest deployment model with the highest performance for GraphQL Federation.
The Cosmo cli ([wgc](/cli)) provides you with a set of tools to create and build router plugins.
Together with the built-in testing framework, router plugins are purpose-built to leverage LLMs to generate adapter code between your GraphQL Schema and the underlying data source.

In addition, the Cosmo Router manages the lifecycle of plugins,
including hot-reloading plugins without any service interruption.
There's no need to deploy "Subgraph" services just to bring an existing API into your Supergraph.

For an overview of gRPC concepts shared between plugins and services, see our [gRPC Concepts documentation](/router/gRPC/concepts).

## What Makes Plugins Unique

Router plugins are local extensions that run as separate processes managed by the Cosmo Router. These plugins:

## Demo and Example

If you prefer to explore new solutions by looking at code and running it locally,
take a look at our [Cosmo Plugin Demo](https://github.com/wundergraph/cosmo-plugin-demo) repository.

## What are Plugins?

Router plugins are extensions that run as separate processes and communicate with the Cosmo Router over Google's Remote Procedure Call ([gRPC](https://grpc.io/)) protocol.

Running as separate processes provides critical fault isolation - if a plugin crashes or encounters a fatal error, it won't bring down your router process.

These plugins implement GraphQL resolvers that can access any data source or service, all while communicating with the Router through a high-performance gRPC interface.

The plugin architecture is built on HashiCorp's battle-tested [go-plugin framework](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-plugin),
which powers production systems like Vault and Terraform with millions of deployments worldwide.
This provides enterprise-grade reliability, secure process isolation, and proven stability for your GraphQL infrastructure.

## Motivation

A lot of companies see the value of GraphQL Federation but are hesitant to adopt it because they have existing systems that are incompatible,
like legacy systems, REST APIs, SOAP, etc...

Router plugins solve this problem by making it very easy to generate adapters between your Supergraph and existing systems.
The plugin system is designed with tools like Cursor, Windsurf, and Copilot in mind.
Define a Subgraph Schema, provide an OpenAPI document, a SOAP WSDL, or even just some curl commands,
and your LLM will be able to generate adapter code and tests in just a few minutes.

Thanks to the strongly-typed proto definition and the built-in testing framework,
LLM coding assistants can quickly iterate on the generated code and ensure it's correct.

Our goal is to allow you to one-shot generate an adapter for an existing system with a single prompt.

    <Card title="Simplify GraphQL Implementation" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
        While everyone understands the value of "one schema, one query," building and maintaining production-grade subgraphs across diverse environments remains challenging. Spec support, runtime performance, and type safety depend on your subgraph framework quality.
    </Card>

    <Card title="Design with GraphQL, Implement with gRPC" icon="code">
        Our approach combines GraphQL's schema-first flexibility with gRPC's performance and type safety.
        Using the same plugin system that powers HashiCorp Vault and Terraform,
        you can develop subgraphs in any language and run them directly in the Cosmo Router.
    </Card>

    <Card title="Proto-Based Code Generation" icon="bolt">
        The strict typing and automatic code generation from Protocol Buffers (proto) definitions provides an immense productivity boost,
        especially in the era of generative AI.
        The generated proto-based gRPC code creates a strongly-typed foundation that AI tools can more effectively understand,
        extend, and modify, reducing development time and errors while ensuring consistent API implementation.
    </Card>

    <Card title="Strongly-Typed Subgraphs" icon="shield-check">
        It's impossible to know if a Subgraph Framework properly implemented the GraphQL Federation contract.
        With router plugins, there's no way to get around the proto definition.
        If the implementation compiles against the proto definition, you know it's correct.
        This eliminates a whole class of issues around Subgraph Implementation Quality.

    <Card title="Apollo Federation Subgraph Interoperability" icon="merge">
        Router plugins are 100% compatible with existing Apollo Federation Subgraph Implementations.
        This means you can use router plugins alongside existing Apollo Federation Subgraphs.
    </Card>

    <Card title="No N+1 Problems" icon="layer-group">
        Declarative approaches like Apollo Connectors suffer from N+1 problems and make it impossible to batch origin requests.
        Router plugins leverage Cosmo Router's DataLoader capabilities which batches requests by default.
    </Card>

    <Card title="No Subgraph Framework Lag" icon="chevrons-right">
        When new features are added to the Apollo Federation Subgraph Specification,
        it can take months for all Subgraph Implementations to catch up.
        Router plugins handle all Federation related logic within the Router,
        only exposing rpc methods for queries, mutations, and entity lookups.
        As a result, you can always immediately take advantage of the latest features in any language that supports gRPC.

    <Card title="Breaking free from Apollo" icon="lock">
        Apollo being the maintainer of the majority of Subgraph Framework implementations limits the speed of innovation.
        With router plugins, we're able to break free from Apollo's constraints and innovate at a much faster pace.

This architecture gives you a unified development experience with consistent tooling across all your subgraphs while enabling seamless integration with your existing infrastructure.

## Router Plugin Architecture

The router plugin architecture works by:

1. **Plugin Registration**: Plugins are registered with the Cosmo Router at startup
2. **Schema Integration**: The plugin's schema is integrated into the federated graph
3. **Request Handling**: When the Router receives a GraphQL request, it routes relevant parts to the appropriate plugins
4. **Inter-Process Communication**: Plugins run in separate processes and communicate with the router via gRPC
5. **Response Assembly**: The Router assembles the complete response from all plugins and regular subgraphs

## Limitations

While powerful, router plugins have some considerations:

- **Language Support**: Currently, only Go and TS (With Bun) are supported for plugin development
- **Deployment Coupling**: Plugins must be deployed with the Router rather than independently

We're working on adding support for more languages and making the deployment workflow much simpler.

## Bootstrapping a Router Plugin

Cosmo provides a set of CLI tools to simplify the process of creating, building, and testing router plugins.
These tools handle much of the boilerplate code generation and build process for you.

### Prerequisites

Before using the plugin CLI tools, make sure you have:
- [WunderGraph Cosmo CLI](/cli) installed
- The Go compiler, protobuf compiler, and protoc plugins are installed automatically by the CLI.
However, you can install them manually if you prefer.

### Creating and Building Plugins

The Cosmo CLI provides the following commands for working with plugins:

- **[`wgc router plugin init`](/cli/router/plugin/init)**: Scaffolds a new router plugin project
- **[`wgc router plugin build`](/cli/router/plugin/build)**: Generates code and builds the plugin
- **[`wgc router plugin test`](/cli/router/plugin/test)**: Runs tests for your plugin

For detailed documentation on each command, visit the [CLI Plugin Commands](/cli/router/plugin) section.

### Typical Workflow

<Note>
  We will ask you to install the dependencies for you to compile and test the plugin. However, for the best experience, we recommend you install the dependencies manually and use a IDE with Go support.
  Please refer to the [CLI Plugin Commands](/cli/router/plugin) documentation for more details.
</Note>

Here is a simplified workflow for creating a router plugin with a fully working router setup:

```bash
# 1️⃣ Initialize a full router project with a plugin
wgc router plugin init hello-world -p myproject --language go

# 2️⃣ Go to the project directory "myproject"
cd myproject

# 3️⃣ Build, compose and start the router. Navigate to http://localhost:3010
make

# 4️⃣ Customize the schema and implementation to your needs
# Edit `./plugins/hello-world/src/schema.graphql`

# 5️⃣ Generate the code for your plugin to implement the resolvers
cd plugins/hello-world && make generate

# 6️⃣ Now you can implement your gRPC resolvers in `./plugins/hello-world/src/main.go` (for Go) or `./plugins/hello-world/src/plugin.ts` (for TypeScript)

# ⭐ Regenerate the code, build the plugin and serve the latest config.
# Navigate to http://localhost:3010 again to query your supergraph
make
```

Every plugin comes with a `Makefile` that provides a set of commands to build, test, and run the plugin.

### Plugin Directory Structure

When you initialize a plugin using `wgc router plugin init`, it creates a complete router project with a hello world plugin.

For more details on the directory structure and build process, see the [`wgc router plugin init`](/cli/router/plugin/init) documentation.

## Debugging Plugins

Please refer to the [Debugging Plugins](/router/gRPC/debugging) documentation for more details.

## Deployment Considerations

When deploying router plugins with your Cosmo Router, keep these important considerations in mind:

### Cosmo Cloud Plugin Registry

Native integration with Cosmo Cloud allows you to push plugins directly to the platform without the need to re-deploy the Router. If you're already using Cosmo Cloud, you can use the `wgc router plugin publish` command to publish your plugin directly to the plugin registry for use by your routers.

### Platform Compatibility

Plugins must be compiled for the same target platform as your router. This means:

- If your router runs on Linux AMD64, your plugins must be built for Linux AMD64
- If deploying to multiple architectures, plugins must be cross-compiled for each target platform

If you're using the Cosmo Cloud Plugin Registry, you can specify platforms using the `--platform` flag when publishing your plugins from the CLI.

### Docker Integration

For containerized router deployments using local plugins:

1. Plugins must be embedded into the same Docker image as the Router
2. The Router's configuration file must correctly reference the plugins path within the container

Example Dockerfile:

This is an example Dockerfile that embeds the plugins into the router image. You can use volume mounts to avoid building specific docker images for each plugin.

```dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/wundergraph/cosmo/router:latest

# Copy the router configuration
COPY config.yaml /app/config.yaml
COPY config.json /app/config.json

# Copy the plugins to the container
COPY ./plugins /app/plugins

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# The entrypoint is already set in the base image
```

## Conclusion

Router plugins for the Cosmo Router provide a powerful way to implement high-performance subgraphs that communicate with the Router via a secure cross-process architecture.
By leveraging the battle-tested HashiCorp go-plugin framework while maintaining clean separation of concerns, they offer the best of both worlds for many use cases.

For complex systems, consider a hybrid approach: use router plugins for performance-critical paths and traditional subgraphs for areas that require independent scaling or deployment.
