## Config Design Overview

This section gives you an overview of how the router handles configuration merging and provides guidance on how you can structure your configurations effectively.

### Configuration Merging

The router lets you load multiple configurations at once. You can specify your configurations in two ways:

1. Using the `CONFIG_PATH` environment variable or in your `.env` file:
```bash
CONFIG_PATH=base.config.yaml,dev.config.yaml
```

2. Using the `config` flag when starting the router:
```bash
# Pass params individually
./router --config base.config.yaml --config dev.config.yaml

# Or pass them as a comma separated list
./router --config base.config.yaml,dev.config.yaml
```

### Environment Variables

The router supports two types of environment variable usage:

1. Direct environment variable settings
2. Environment variable interpolation in YAML configurations

#### Environment Variable Precedence

Environment variables have the lowest precedence in the configuration hierarchy:
- They are loaded first
- Can be overridden by YAML configurations
- YAML configurations have higher precedence

You have two options for environment files:
- A base `.env` file for your common settings
- An override environment file using `OVERRIDE_ENV` for environment-specific settings

The values from your `OVERRIDE_ENV` file will take precedence over the base `.env` file (if you have one).

<Warning>
All configuration values do not have an environment var assigned to it. If you require to set something by env vars, but it does not exist, do not hesitate to get in touch with us.
</Warning>

### Environment Variable Interpolation

We also allow the interpolation / expanding of environment variables in YAML's by using the following syntax
```bash
${ENVAR}
```

This allows you to do for example the following
```yaml
readiness_check_path: /${READINESS_PATH}/${SUFFIX_URL}

#OR 

readiness_check_path: ${READINESS_CHECK_PATH}
```

With the following environment variables
```bash
READINESS_PATH=ready
SUFFIX_URL=check

READINESS_CHECK_PATH=/ready/check
```

Which will result in 

```yaml
readiness_check_path: /ready/check
```

<Warning>
When using environment variable interpolation, make sure the environment variables are set before the router starts. If an environment variable is not set, the interpolation will result in no value.
</Warning>

#### Understanding Environment Variable Interpolation

Environment variable interpolation provides a way to use environment variables as the source of truth in your configuration. This is particularly useful for:

- Path configurations that might change between environments
- Sensitive values that should be managed through environment variables
- Values that need to be dynamically set during deployment

For example, if you have a default environment variable like `READINESS_CHECK_PATH`, you can:
1. Use it directly in your YAML through interpolation (`${READINESS_CHECK_PATH}`)
2. Change its value through environment variables without modifying the YAML
3. Maintain consistency across different environments

This approach is especially valuable when you want to ensure that certain values are always controlled by environment variables rather than being overridden by YAML configurations.

#### How Merging Works

Before we merge your configurations, we validate each YAML file against our [configuration schema](/router/configuration#config-validation-%26-auto-completion). This ensures everything is valid before we start combining them.

Here's how the merging process works:
- The last configuration in your list has the highest priority
- If a key exists in multiple files, the last one wins
- New keys get added if they don't exist yet
- After merging, we validate everything again to make sure all rules are followed

Let's look at a simple example to see how this works:

**base.yaml**
```yaml
listen_addr: 127.0.0.1:3007
poll_interval: 17s
```

**dev.yaml**
```yaml
listen_addr: listen.address:3007
readiness_check_path: /health/ready/check
```

The final output will be:
```yaml
listen_addr: listen.address:3007
poll_interval: 17s
readiness_check_path: /health/ready/check
```

As you can see, `listen_addr` from dev.yaml overrode the one from base.yaml, while `poll_interval` carried forward since it wasn't overridden.

If we add another file after **dev.yaml**:
```yaml
listen_addr: new.address:3007
readiness_check_path: /health/ready/check
```

The final output becomes:
```yaml
listen_addr: new.address:3007
poll_interval: 17s
readiness_check_path: /health/ready/check
```

> **Important Note**: When dealing with lists in your YAML configurations, the entire list gets replaced rather than merged. This is especially important to remember when your list elements have a `key` attribute.

Here's an example to show what we mean:

**base.yaml**
```yaml
telemetry:
  attributes:
    - key: content_type
      default: 'no-content-type-found'
      value_from:
        request_header: content-type
```

**dev.yaml**
```yaml
listen_addr: 127.0.0.1:3007
telemetry:
  attributes:
    - key: operation_sha
      default: 'no_sha'
      value_from:
        context_field: operation_sha256
    - key: operation_validation_time
      default: 'no_validation_time'
      value_from:
        context_field: operation_validation_time
```

The final output will be:
```yaml
listen_addr: 127.0.0.1:3007
telemetry:
  attributes:
    - key: operation_sha
      default: 'no_sha'
      value_from:
        context_field: operation_sha256
    - key: operation_validation_time
      default: 'no_validation_time'
      value_from:
        context_field: operation_validation_time
```

Likewise another caveat is that you should keep in mind validation rules when attempting to design configurations so that it can be merged. Let's take a look at the following example.

**base.config.yaml**
```yaml
execution_config:
  file:
    path: execution_config.json
    watch: true
    watch_interval: 5s
```

**dev.config.yaml**
```yaml
execution_config:
  file:
    path: execution_config.json
    watch: false
```

In this example, we run into a validation issue after merging. The JSON schema requires that `watch_interval` cannot be present when `watch` is `false`. While each individual configuration file is valid, the merged result becomes invalid because `watch_interval` from the base config remains even though `watch` is set to `false` in the dev config.

To handle this scenario, you have two options:

1. **Recommended Approach**: Set `watch: false` as the default in your base configuration and explicitly enable it where needed:
```yaml
# base.config.yaml
execution_config:
  file:
    path: execution_config.json
    watch: false

# dev.config.yaml
execution_config:
  file:
    path: execution_config.json
    watch: true
    watch_interval: 5s
```

2. **Alternative Approach**: Create separate configurations for different watch settings:
```yaml
# base.config.yaml
execution_config:
  file:
    path: execution_config.json

# watch-enabled.config.yaml
execution_config:
  file:
    watch: true
    watch_interval: 5s

# watch-disabled.config.yaml
execution_config:
  file:
    watch: false
```

The first approach is generally recommended as it makes the configuration intent clearer and reduces the number of configuration files you need to manage.

### Hot Config Reloading

When you enable [hot config reloading](/router/configuration#config-watcher-hot-reloading), we'll watch all your configuration files for changes. Whenever any configuration changes, we'll reprocess everything and rebuild your final merged configuration.

<Warning>
The router does not support reloading of .env files at this moment, and any .env change will require you to restart the router.
</Warning>

## Designing Configurations

Before configuration merging, you had to use one big configuration file, which could get messy and hard to maintain. Now you can split your configurations into smaller, more manageable pieces. Here are some ways you can structure your configurations:

### Environment-Based Structure

This is a common approach where you split your configs by environment:

```
config/
  base.config.yaml
  dev/
    dev.config.yaml
  staging/
    stage.config.yaml
  production/
    prod.config.yaml
```

You can use these environment variables for each environment:
```bash
# for dev
CONFIG_PATH=base.config.yaml,./dev/dev.config.yaml

# for staging
CONFIG_PATH=base.config.yaml,./staging/stage.config.yaml

# for prod
CONFIG_PATH=base.config.yaml,./production/prod.config.yaml
```

### Feature-Based Structure

You can also organize your configs by feature:

```
config/
  rate_limit.yaml
  telemetry.yaml
  prod/
    telemetry.yaml
    tracing.yaml
    metrics.yaml
```

Here's how you might use these configs:
```bash
# for prod
CONFIG_PATH=rate_limit.yaml,telemetry.yaml,./prod/telemetry.yaml,./prod/tracing.yaml,./prod/metrics.yaml
```

> **Note**: When using this approach, be careful not to accidentally duplicate attributes across different files. For example, if you define a rate limiting attribute in both `rate_limit.yaml` and `telemetry.yaml`, the one in `telemetry.yaml` will override the other.

### Combining Configuration and Environment Files

You can even combine both approaches with environment variables:

```
config/
  base.config.yaml
  .env
  dev/
    .env.dev
    dev.config.yaml
  staging/
    .env.stage
    stage.config.yaml
  production/
    .env.prod
    prod.config.yaml
```

For your staging environment, you would set:
```bash
OVERRIDE_ENV=./staging/.env.stage
```

These configuration patterns are suggestions to help you get started. Feel free to adapt them to match your specific requirements and organizational needs. The key is to maintain a structure that makes sense for your team and use case.
