## For Docker Image and Helm Chart

If you consume the router as a Docker image, you can simply pull the latest image and restart your container. Please take a look at the [Deployment and Hosting](/deployments-and-hosting/release-management) page to learn more about how we version the router.

## For Custom Builds

If you have built your own custom router, you can follow the upgrade instructions in the [Router Examples](https://github.com/wundergraph/router-examples) repository.
