Cosmo Router provides powerful handlers to hook into the event processing of Cosmo Streams.
These handlers allow you to implement custom logic for subscription lifecycle management, event processing and data transformation.

## Available Hooks

The Cosmo Streams system provides three main hook interfaces that you can implement with [Custom Modules](/router/custom-modules):

- [`SubscriptionOnStartHandler`](/router/event-driven-federated-subscriptions-edfs/custom-modules/on-subscription-start): Called when a client subscribes
- [`OnReceiveEventHandler`](/router/event-driven-federated-subscriptions-edfs/custom-modules/on-receive-event): Called when events are received from a message broker
- [`OnPublishEventHandler`](/router/event-driven-federated-subscriptions-edfs/custom-modules/on-publish-event): Called when events are going to be sent to a message broker
