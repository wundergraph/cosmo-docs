Every company and project is different. Our team of Solution Architects is happy to consult with you to find the right solution for your use case. For more information, a demo, Q\&A with our Engineers and Solution Architects, please contact our friendly [sales team](https://wundergraph.com/contact/sales).

## Cosmo is built on top of Open Source & Open Standards

Cosmo is fully open-source and will always remain so. Its extensive range of features makes it one of the most advanced, secure, and cost-efficient GraphQL platforms for both small and large companies.

While you have the option to operate the open-source solution independently, we strongly advise considering our services. This recommendation comes from a place of caution and care: Managing a platform at this complexity level without the necessary expertise could pose risks to your business. We're here to assist, ensuring you make the most of this solution safely and effectively.

At WunderGraph, we have an in-depth understanding of how the software works and how to operate every single component.

We're building the most secure GraphQL Federation solution by betting on three elements:

<Card title="Open Standards" icon="square-2" horizontal/>
<Card title="Transparency" icon="square-3" horizontal/>
</CardGroup>

Cosmo builds on top of the following Open Source technologies:

* Kubernetes (for deployments)

* PostgreSQL (central storage of record)

* Redis (Workflows, CRON Jobs, Cache)

* ClickHouse (Analytics, Tracing, Metrics)

* Keycloak (Federated Authentication)

In addition, we use the following standards and protocols:

* OpenTelemetry

* OpenFederation

* Prometheus

* OpenID Connect

## Cosmo Enterprise: Dedicated Cloud

For the most advanced use cases, we offer Cosmo Dedicated Cloud, a fully isolated, end-to-end secure, SOC 2-certified deployment of Cosmo Cloud.

Cosmo Dedicated Cloud is a fully managed service with SLAs, available in AWS, GCP, and Azure.

Custom release cycles can be defined, so you're not forced to follow all major updates at the same pace as the regular Cosmo Cloud.

## Support for Strictly Regulated Industries

Some organizations operate under very strict regulation. WunderGraph Cosmo Cloud is SOC 2 compliant and fully fit for purpose. However, in the strictest of such scenarios and as a last resort, WunderGraph Cosmo can be fully self-hosted and self-managed. And our team of Solution Architects and Support Engineers stand ready to help navigate the increased costs and complexities that naturally arise in these scenarios.

Indeed, the process of setting up any solution to satisfy security audits, SLAs, and other internal constraints, can be complex, time-consuming, and error prone--and self-hosting / self-managing WunderGraph Cosmo is no exception. From ensuring end-to-end encryption, to configuring every component correctly, our team is ready to help create scalable, maintainable, and healthy deployments that shine even in the toughest of conditions.

Teams turn to WunderGraph for help with:

* Network Architecture & Security;

* Component Configuration, Upgrades, and Maintenance;

* Database Migrations;

* Capacity Planning for Cosmo Router, OTEL, & GraphQL Metrics Collectors;

* Horizontal Scalability;

* And So Much More!

## 100% Air-Gapped GraphQL Federation

It's noteworthy that Cosmo Dedicated Cloud can be run in 100% air-gapped scenarios without access to the public internet. As all components are Open Source, including Cosmo, this is the most secure and transparent solution to pass the most demanding audits.

## Solution Architects

As part of our enterprise contract, we offer a direct support channel (Slack, Teams) with our Solution Architects.

Our Solution Architects help your teams with questions about Subgraph Architecture, Schema Design, Implementing Authentication and Authorization Policies properly, improving the performance and reliability of your Graphs, and many more topics.

## Support Engineers

In addition, our Support Engineers help your team to maximize the benefits of Cosmo. We assist with deployment, ongoing maintenance, migrations, and support for long-term release versions.

## Incentives of an Open Source Company vs Closed Source

Compared to our competitors, Cosmo is 100% Open Source under the Apache 2.0 license. Being Open Source as a company has an impact on the incentives.

A closed-source Company is incentivized by locking customers into its ecosystem with features that are subject to a non-OSI-compliant license. Customers who depend on closed-source features cannot easily move to a different vendor. This way, you're subject to price increases without getting significant additional value.

WunderGraph on the other hand, being 100% Open Source is committed to continuously innovating and offering you the most advanced solution. With Cosmo Enterprise, you pay a fair market price for the value of our services instead of being vendor-locked into an overpriced inferior solution.

## Key Benefits Cosmo Enterprise

* 100% Open Source, transparent, secure, and easy to pass audits

* dedicated, isolated deployment of Cosmo Cloud

* direct access to the best GraphQL Federation team in the market

* super fast turnaround for bugs and problems
