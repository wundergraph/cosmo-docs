This page demonstrates how your platform enables API consumers to interact with the API using standard gRPC tooling.

Platform teams can adapt the examples on this page when creating consumer-facing documentation to ensure a consistent and supported API consumption experience.

For internal microservices, backend systems, or high-performance mobile applications, consumers can interact with the API using the binary gRPC protocol over HTTP/2.

## Prerequisites

To consume the API via standard gRPC clients, consumers need two things provided by the platform team:

1. Connection Details: The host and port where the router's ConnectRPC server is listening (e.g., localhost:5026).

2. Service Definitions: The service.proto file generated during the build step. This file is required to define the available services, methods, and message structures for binary serialization.

## Ad-Hoc testing with `grpcurl`

`grpcurl` is a widely used command-line tool that lets you interact with gRPC servers, similar to how `curl` works for HTTP. 
It is excellent for testing and debugging without generating code.

### Command structure

To make a request, you need to point `grpcurl` to your local `.proto` definition file, specify the plaintext flag (unless TLS is configured), provide the request data as JSON, and specify the target endpoint and fully qualified method name.

In production environments, TLS is typically enabled and the `-plaintext` flag should be omitted.

```bash
grpcurl -plaintext \
  -proto <path_to_service.proto> \
  -d '<json_request_body>' \
  <host>:<port> \
  <package_name>.<ServiceName>/<MethodName>
```

## Examples

The following examples assume the router is listening locally on port `5026` and the proto definitions are available in a local `./services/service.proto` file.

### GetEmployeeById

Retrieve an employee by their ID.

```bash
grpcurl -plaintext \
  -proto ./services/service.proto \
  -d '{"id": 1}' \
  localhost:5026 \
  employees.v1.HrService/GetEmployeeById
```

### UpdateEmployeeMood

Update data on the server.

```bash
grpcurl -plaintext \
  -proto ./services/service.proto \
  -d '{"id": 1, "mood": "MOOD_HAPPY"}' \
  localhost:5026 \
  employees.v1.HrService/UpdateEmployeeMood
```

## Programmatic gRPC Clients

While `grpcurl` is useful for testing, nearly every major programming language has robust library support for gRPC. Consumers can use standard `protoc` code generation tools against the provided `service.proto` file to build high-performance, typed clients for backend services.

<Note> For the best developer experience in languages like TypeScript, Go, and Kotlin, we recommend using the pre-generated [SDKs](/connect-rpc/consume-via-sdks) instead of raw gRPC clients. </Note>
