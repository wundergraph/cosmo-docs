When developing new features, it is crucial to test them in a production-like environment. By generating a preview for each pull request (PR), developers can ensure that their changes are thoroughly tested in such an environment before being merged.

By utilizing [Graph Feature Flags](https://cosmo-docs.wundergraph.com/concepts/feature-flags), the continuous integration (CI) pipeline can deploy a new feature subgraph and corresponding feature flag for each PR, enabling one composition per PR without deploying all subgraphs. The only requirement is a staging environment deployed from the main branches of your subgraphs. Graph feature flags allow you to "override" the subgraphs for a specific pull request.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

Before using the Cosmo Previews GitHub Action, ensure that the following prerequisites are met:

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Cosmo API Key" icon="square-1" href="/studio/api-keys">
    You must have a valid API key from WunderGraph Cosmo, which should be stored
    as a secret in your GitHub repository under `COSMO_API_KEY`.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Configuration File" icon="square-2" href="/studio/api-keys">
    Create a `cosmo.yaml` file in the `.github` directory of your repository.
    This file should define the configuration for your subgraphs and feature
    flags.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Subgraphs on Wundergraph Cosmo"
    icon="square-3"
    href="/studio/api-keys"
  >
    All subgraphs referenced in the cosmo.yaml file must be created and
    published on Wundergraph Cosmo. Ensure that these subgraphs are correctly
    configured.
  </Card>
  <Card title="GitHub Token" icon="square-4" href="/studio/api-keys">
    The GitHub token is automatically provided by GitHub Actions, but ensure it
    is correctly referenced.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Setup

To use this action in your repository:

1. Create a `.github/cosmo.yaml` file that defines the configuration for your feature subgraphs and feature flags.

```bash
version: '0.0.1'
namespace: '<your-namespace>'
feature_flags:
  - name: '<your-feature-flag>'
    labels:
      - '<label-1>'
      - '<label-2>'

subgraphs:
  - name: '<subgraph-1-name>'
    schema_path: '<path-to-schema-1>'
    routing_url: '<routing-url-1>'

  - name: '<subgraph-2-name>'
    schema_path: '<path-to-schema-2>'
    routing_url: '<routing-url-2>'
```

- The paths to schema files should be relative to the root of your repository.

- The `routing_url` can include the placeholder string '$\{PR_NUMBER}', which will be replaced with the actual PR number. This enables deployment of the subgraph to a unique URL for each pull request.

- Feature flag labels must match the federated graph for which the preview is created.

- Ensure that the subgraphs mentioned in cosmo.yaml are a part of a federated graph.

2 . Add the following GitHub Action workflow to your repository.

#### Example Workflow

```yaml

        with:
          config_path: .github/cosmo.yaml
          destroy: true

## Jobs

### Create

The `create` job is triggered when a pull request is opened or reopened. It performs the following actions:

1. Checks out the repository.

2. Sets up Node.js using the version specified.

3. Installs the latest version of the `wgc` CLI tool.

4. Creates feature subgraphs for all the GraphQL files modified in the pull request, provided that their corresponding subgraph configuration is specified in the `cosmo.yaml` file.

5. Creates all the feature flags specified in the `cosmo.yaml` file.

### Update

The `update` job is triggered when a pull request is synchronized. It performs the following actions:

1. Checks out the repository.

2. Sets up Node.js with the specified version.

3. Installs the latest version of the `wgc` CLI tool.

4. Creates/ Updates the feature subgraphs for all the newly modified GraphQL files in the pull request, provided that their corresponding subgraph configuration is specified in the `cosmo.yaml` file.

5. Updates all the feature flags specified in the `cosmo.yaml` file.

### Destroy

The `destroy` job is triggered when a pull request is closed. It performs the following actions:

1. Checks out the repository.

2. Sets up Node.js using the version specified.

3. Installs the latest version of the `wgc` CLI tool.

4. Destroys all the feature flags and feature subgraphs created for the pull request.

## Outputs

- `feature_subgraphs_to_deploy`: A list of feature subgraphs to deploy. This output is provided in the create and update jobs.

- `feature_subgraphs_to_destroy`: A list of feature subgraphs to destroy. This output is provided in the update and destroy jobs.

## Limitations

- The cosmo.yaml file should not be changed after the pull request is opened. If changes are to be made, the pull request should be closed and reopened. Make sure that the destroy action is completed before reopening the pull request.
