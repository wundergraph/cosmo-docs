  before applying.
</Info>

## Description

The `npx wgc proposal create` command allows you to create a new proposal for federated graph changes within the Cosmo platform. Proposals provide a way to suggest and review modifications to subgraphs within a federated graph before applying them. You can include existing subgraphs with schema changes, add new subgraphs, or remove existing subgraphs in a proposal.

## **Parameters**

- `[name]`: The name of the proposal you want to create. It should be a descriptive identifier for the proposal.

## **Options**

- `-f, --federation-graph <federatedGraphName>` (required): The name of the federated graph this proposal is for.

- `-n, --namespace [namespace]` : The namespace of the federated graph (Default: "default").

- `--subgraph <subgraph>`: Specify a subgraph to include in the proposal with its updated schema. Can be specified multiple times for different subgraphs.

  - Format: `name:subgraph-name,schemaPath:path-to-schema`
  - Example: `--subgraph name:products,schemaPath:./schemas/products.graphql`

- `--new-subgraph <subgraph>`: Specify a new subgraph to add in the proposal. Can be specified multiple times.

  - Format: `name:subgraph-name,schemaPath:path-to-schema,labels:"key=value key=value"`
  - Example: `--new-subgraph name:reviews,schemaPath:./schemas/reviews.graphql,labels:"team=B department=engineering"`

- `--deleted-subgraph <name>`: Specify a subgraph to be deleted in the proposal. Can be specified multiple times.
  - Example: `--deleted-subgraph legacy-products`

<Note>
  At least one of `--subgraph`, `--new-subgraph`, or `--deleted-subgraph` must be provided.
</Note>

## **Examples**

### Update an existing subgraph

```bash
npx wgc proposal create update-products --federation-graph my-graph --subgraph name:products,schemaPath:./schemas/products.graphql
```

### Add a new subgraph

```bash
npx wgc proposal create add-reviews --federation-graph my-graph --new-subgraph name:reviews,schemaPath:./schemas/reviews.graphql,labels:"team=product"
```

### Remove a subgraph

```bash
npx wgc proposal create remove-legacy --federation-graph my-graph --deleted-subgraph legacy-products
```

### Complex proposal with multiple changes

```bash
npx wgc proposal create quarterly-update --federation-graph my-graph \
  --subgraph name:products,schemaPath:./schemas/products.graphql \
  --new-subgraph name:reviews,schemaPath:./schemas/reviews.graphql,labels:"team=product" \
  --deleted-subgraph legacy-products
```
