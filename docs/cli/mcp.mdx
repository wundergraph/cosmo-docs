## Overview

The Cosmo MCP Server allows developers to integrate Cosmo into their modern LLM/AI supported IDEs.
The implementation is running fully on the client side using STDIO.
As such, the MCP Server requires no additional setup on your machine other than setting up the `wgc` CLI tool with an API key.

## Installation

To install the MCP Server, you'll need to create an API key and configure your IDE to use it.

### 1. Create a new API key

You can create an API key in [Cosmo Studio](https://cosmo.wundergraph.com).

![Graphs section with Members tab](/images/studio/graphs-section-with-members-tab.png)

### 2. Configure your IDE

Add the following configuration to your IDE's settings.
You'll need to replace `cosmo_<redacted>` with your actual API key.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cosmo": {
      "command": "npx wgc",
      "args": ["mcp"],
      "env": {
        "COSMO_API_KEY": "cosmo_<redacted>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Useful Prompts

Here are some example prompts you can use to get started.

### Setting the Context

```
For the whole conversation,
if not otherwise specified,
assume that we're always working in the context of the
Namespace "default"
and the Supergraph "mygraph".
```

### Schema Exploration

_Load the schema of the Supergraph and summarize the core features_

```
Supergraph: mygraph
Namespace: default

Show me the core features of this Supergraph.
```

---

_Find out which subgraphs are part of the Supergraph_

```
Supergraph: mygraph
Namespace: default

Which subgraphs are part of this Supergraph?
```

---

_Load the SDL of the Supergraph_

```
Supergraph: mygraph
Namespace: default

Show me the schema for this Supergraph.
```

---

_Explore sub-sections of the Supergraph schema_

```
Supergraph: mygraph
Namespace: default

Show me the schema for the Employee type in this Supergraph.
```

### Dream Query Workflow

```
Supergraph: mygraph
Namespace: default

Use the dream_query_workflow
to enable the following query
on this Supergraph:

query {
  employees {
    name
    department {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

The dream_query_workflow guides the AI model through the process of adding the necessary schema changes to your Subgraphs to enable a new use case in your Supergraph.
It will find out which Subgraphs are best to modify,
and it will verify that the changes are composable and backwards compatible.

### Schema Change Proposal Workflow

```
Supergraph: mygraph
Namespace: default

Use the schema_change_proposal_workflow
to add the field "age: Int!"
to the "Employee" type
in this Supergraph.
```

This workflow is a sub-workflow of the dream_query_workflow.
Instead of starting from a query,
it starts with instructions on what specifically to change in the schema.

### AI-assisted Router Configuration

_Use the Router Config Reference to make changes to the Router config_

```
Look into the cosmo_router_config_reference
and help me to configure a custom GraphQL endpoint
in my Router config: router.yaml
```

---

_Use the Router Config Reference to enable WebSockets_

```
Look into the cosmo_router_config_reference
and help me to enable WebSockets
in my Router config: router.yaml
```

### Documentation Search

_Use fulltext search on the documentation to enable specific features in the Router config_

```
Look into the cosmo documentation
and help me to properly configure CORS
in my Router config: router.yaml
```

---

_Use fulltext search on the documentation to understand the steps to publish a Subgraph_

```
Look into the cosmo documentation
and explain to me the steps to publish a Subgraph.
```

## All Available Tools (Reference)

The MCP server exposes several tools that an AI model can utilize:

### Subgraph Management

- **`list_subgraphs`**: Lists all subgraphs registered in your Cosmo Platform instance.
  - _Use Case_: Discovering available subgraphs.
- **`get_subgraphs`**: Retrieves detailed information for specified subgraphs, including their GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL).
  - _Use Case_: Inspecting the schema or configuration of specific subgraphs.
- **`introspect_subgraph`**: Introspects a running subgraph endpoint to retrieve its current GraphQL schema.
  - _Use Case_: Fetching the latest schema directly from a subgraph instance, useful for verifying deployments or comparing against registered schemas.
- **`subgraph_verify_schema_changes`**: Validates proposed changes to a subgraph's schema. It checks for valid GraphQL SDL, composition compatibility with other subgraphs, and potential breaking changes against client traffic (optional).
  - _Use Case_: Safely validating schema modifications before deployment.

### Supergraph (Federated Graph) Management

- **`list_supergraphs`**: Lists all federated graphs (Supergraphs) in your Cosmo Platform instance, optionally filtered by namespace.
  - _Use Case_: Discovering available Supergraphs.
- **`fetch_supergraph`**: Fetches the composed schema (SDL and client schema) and configuration details for a specific Supergraph.
  - _Use Case_: Examining the structure and configuration of a Supergraph.
- **`fetch_supergraph_router_config`**: Retrieves the router configuration (e.g., for WunderGraph Cosmo Router) for a specific Supergraph.
  - _Use Case_: Obtaining the necessary configuration to run a compatible router instance.
- **`fetch_supergraph_subgraphs`**: Fetches a list of all subgraphs that are part of a specific Supergraph, including their individual schemas and routing information.
  - _Use Case_: Understanding the composition of a Supergraph and its constituent subgraphs.

### Schema Evolution & Query Workflows

- **`schema_change_proposal_workflow`**: Generates a step-by-step guide or set of instructions for making a specific schema change to a Supergraph safely and effectively.
  - _Use Case_: Assisting developers in planning and executing schema changes.
- **`dream_query_workflow`**: Takes a desired GraphQL query and generates instructions on the necessary schema modifications across relevant subgraphs to support that query within a Supergraph.
  - _Use Case_: Streamlining the process of evolving the Supergraph schema to meet new data requirements expressed via GraphQL queries.
- **`verify_query_against_remote_schema`**: Validates a given GraphQL query against the schema of a deployed Supergraph in your Cosmo Platform instance.
  - _Use Case_: Checking if a query is valid before integrating it into an application.
- **`verify_query_against_in_memory_schema`**: Validates a given GraphQL query against a provided Supergraph schema string (e.g., a locally composed schema).
  - _Use Case_: Testing queries against local or proposed schema changes without needing a deployed Supergraph.

### Supergraph Changelog

- **`supergraph_changelog`**: Fetches the changelog for a federated graph / Supergraph.
  - _Use Case_: Reviewing the history of schema changes and composition updates for a Supergraph.

### Router Configuration Verification

- **`verify_router_config`**: Verifies a provided Cosmo Router configuration (JSON or YAML) for validity.
  - _Use Case_: Ensuring a proposed router configuration is syntactically correct and valid before deployment.
- **`cosmo_router_config_reference`**: Provides a reference for the Cosmo Router configuration.
  - _Use Case_: Understanding the syntax and structure of the Cosmo Router configuration.

### Documentation Search

- **`search_docs`**: Searches the official WunderGraph Cosmo documentation for a given query.
  - _Use Case_: Finding relevant documentation pages for specific features, concepts, or troubleshooting steps.
