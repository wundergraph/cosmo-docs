## Usage

```bash
npx wgc monograph update <name> [-r, --routing-url <url>] [--readme <path-to-readme>]
```

## Description

The `npx wgc monograph update` command allows you to update an existing monograph on the Cosmo platform's control plane. With this command, you can modify the routing URL, graphql server endpoint, subscription configuration and readme.

## Parameters

* `<name>`: The name of the monograph you want to update. This should be the exact name of the monograph you wish to modify.

## Options

* `-n, --namespace` : The namespace of the monograph (Default: "default").

* `-r, --routing-url <url>`: This is the url that the router will be accessible at.

* `-u, --graph-url <url>`: The url of your GraphQL server that is accessible from the router.

* `--subscription-url:` Optionally, use a different URL for subscription requests. If no subscription URL is provided, the router URL is used for subscriptions. To remove a previously set subscription URL, use the flag without provided a URL argument.

* `--subscription-protocol:` Optionally, set a protocol to use for subscriptions. The available options are:

  * `ws` (default): Negotiate an appropriate protocol over websockets. Both `graphql-ws` and `subscription-transport-ws` are supported.

  * `sse`: Use Server-Sent Events with a GET request.

  * `sse_post`: Use Server-Sent events with a POST request.

* `--readme <path-to-readme>:` The path to the markdown file which describes the monograph.

* `--websocket-subprotocol:` The subprotocol to use when subscribing to the monograph. The supported protocols are auto(default), graphql-ws, and graphql-transport-ws. It should be used only if the subscription protocol is ws.

* `--admission-webhook-url <url>` the base url of the admission webhook. This is the url that the controlplane will use to implement admission control for the federated graph.

* `--admission-webhook-secret`: Allows you to sign requests (HMAC) made to your admission webhook url. The header containing this signature is `X-Cosmo-Signature-256`

## Example

Update the routing URL of the monograph "production":

```bash
npx wgc monograph update production -r http://new-domain.com/graphql
```

## Notes

* The `npx wgc monograph update` command interacts with the Cosmo platform's control plane to update the specified monograph.

* You can combine the options in a single command to update multiple things.
