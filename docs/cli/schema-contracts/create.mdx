## Usage

#### Exclude (the items that have the tag(s) specified will be removed from the federated graph)

```bash
npx wgc contract create <name> --source <federated-graph-name> --exclude internal -r <routing-url>
```

#### Include (the items that have the tag(s) specified will be included in the federated graph)

```bash
npx wgc contract create <name> --source <federated-graph-name> --include public -r <routing-url>
```

## Description

The `npx wgc contract create` command allows you to create a contract from a federated graph or monograph by providing tags to exclude from the schema. This will create a new contract graph linked to the source graph.

## Parameters

- `<name>`: The name of the contract graph you want to create.

## Required Options

`-r , --routing-url`: The routing URL of your router. This URL defines the endpoint where the router will be accessible. The contract graph will be accessible through this router.

`--source`: The name of the source graph from which contract is created.

## Options

<Note>
  The --exclude and --include options are currently _mutually exclusive_. An error will be returned if more than one are defined.
</Note>

- `-n, --namespace` : The namespace of the contract graph and source graph (Default: "default").
- `--exclude` : The list of tags that need to be excluded from the source graph schema.
- `--include` : The list of tags that need to be included from the source graph schema.
- `--admission-webhook-url <url>` the base url of the admission webhook. This is the url that the controlplane will use to implement admission control for the contract graph. Example: `https://admission.example.com` (without the `/validate-config` path name)
- `--admission-webhook-secret`: Allows you to sign requests (HMAC) made to your admission webhook url. The header containing this signature is `X-Cosmo-Signature-256`
- `--readme` : The markdown file which describes the contract graph.
- `--suppress-warnings`: This flag suppresses any warnings produced by composition.

## Examples

```bash
npx wgc contract create production-external --source production --exlude internal experimental -r http://router.example.com/graphql
```

Create a contract graph named `production-external` from the source graph schema of `production` that excludes all schema elements tagged with `internal` or `experimental`.

```bash
npx wgc contract create production-external --source production --include public api -r http://router.example.com/graphql
```

Create a contract graph named `production-external` from the source graph schema of `production` that excludes all schema elements tagged with `public` or `api`.
