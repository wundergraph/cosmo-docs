## Description

Update a feature subgraph within the specified (otherwise "default") namespace. A feature subgraph is an "override" of an existing subgraph.

## Usage

The command to update the feature subgraph is the same as the subgraph. Please refer to [subgraph update](/cli/subgraph/update).

<Info>
  Feature subgraph labels cannot be changed. Feature subgraph labels are
  determined by the feature flag they compose.
