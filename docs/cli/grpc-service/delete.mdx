## Usage

```bash
wgc grpc-service delete <name> [-f, --force]
```

<Note>
  **Delete** is an irreversible action. However, the change will only be visible
  to the routers once the composition has been successful. Until then, the
  routers will operate with the most recent valid composition. Please use
  [subgraph check](/cli/subgraph/check) to understand the impact of your change.
</Note>

## Description

The `wgc grpc-service delete` command allows you to delete a gRPC subgraph on the Cosmo platform's control plane. When you delete a gRPC subgraph, all associated data and configurations will be permanently removed. Use this command with caution, as the action cannot be undone.

## Parameters

- `<name>`: The name of the gRPC subgraph you want to delete. This should be the exact name of the gRPC subgraph you wish to remove.

## Options

- `-n, --namespace [string]`: The namespace of the gRPC subgraph (Default: "default").

- `-f, --force`: An optional flag that allows you to force delete the gRPC subgraph without being prompted for confirmation. Use this option if you want to delete the gRPC subgraph without additional prompts.

- `--suppress-warnings`: This flag suppresses any warnings produced by composition.

## Examples

1. Delete the gRPC subgraph named "users-service":

   ```bash
   wgc grpc-service delete users-service
   ```

2. Force delete the gRPC subgraph named "users-service" without confirmation:

   ```bash
   wgc grpc-service delete users-service -f
   ```

3. Delete a gRPC subgraph in a specific namespace:

   ```bash
   wgc grpc-service delete users-service -n production
   ```

## Notes

- The `wgc grpc-service delete` command interacts with the Cosmo platform's control plane to delete the specified gRPC subgraph.

- When using the `--force` option, the command will not prompt for confirmation, so exercise caution to prevent accidental data loss.

- If composition errors occur during deletion, the gRPC subgraph will still be deleted, but the router will continue to work with the latest valid schema until the composition issues are resolved.
