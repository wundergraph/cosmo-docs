icon: unlink

## Usage

```bash
npx wgc subgraph unlink <source-subgraph-name>
```

## Description

The `npx wgc subgraph unlink` command allows you to unlink a source subgraph from its linked target subgraph on the control plane. This removes the connection that was previously established using the [wgc subgraph link](/cli/subgraph/link) command.

After unlinking, schema checks performed on the source subgraph will no longer include validation against the previously linked target subgraph. This is useful when you want to stop cross-environment validation or when the linking relationship is no longer needed.

## Parameters

- `<source-subgraph-name>`: The name of the subgraph that you want to unlink. This should be the same subgraph that was previously linked using the `link` command.

## Options

- `-n, --namespace <string>`: The namespace of the source subgraph (Default: "default").

## Examples

1. Unlink a subgraph named "products" in the default namespace:

   ```bash
   npx wgc subgraph unlink products
   ```

2. Unlink a subgraph named "inventory" in the "staging" namespace:

   ```bash
   npx wgc subgraph unlink inventory -n staging
   ```

3. Unlink a subgraph with explicit namespace specification:

   ```bash
   npx wgc subgraph unlink orders --namespace development
   ```

## Notes

- The unlink operation only affects the source subgraph specified in the command. If you have multiple subgraphs linked to different targets, you need to unlink each one individually.

- After unlinking, the subgraph will continue to function normally, but schema validation will no longer include checks against the previously linked target subgraph.

- You can re-link the same subgraph to the same or different target subgraph at any time using the [wgc subgraph link](/cli/subgraph/link) command.

- Ensure you have the necessary permissions to unlink subgraphs in the specified namespace.
