# wgc router plugin build

The `build` command generates gRPC code based on your GraphQL schema and compiles your plugin into platform-specific binaries.

## Usage

```bash
wgc router plugin build [options] [directory]
```

## Arguments

| Argument | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `directory` | Directory of the plugin | `.` (current directory) |

## Options

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `--generate-only` | Generate only the proto and mapping files, do not compile the plugin | `false` |
| `--go-module-path <path>` | Go module path to use for the plugin | `github.com/wundergraph/cosmo/plugin` |
| `--debug` | Build the binary with debug information for use with debuggers | `false` |
| `--platform [platforms...]` | Platform-architecture combinations (e.g., darwin-arm64 linux-amd64) | Host platform |
| `--all-platforms` | Build for all supported platforms | `false` |
| `--skip-tools-installation` | Skip tool installation | `false` |
| `--force-tools-installation` | Force tools installation regardless of version check or confirmation | `false` |

## Description

This command performs several steps to build your plugin:

1. **Generate Proto and Mapping Files**: Processes your GraphQL schema to generate Protocol Buffers definitions and mapping files
2. **Generate gRPC Code**: Uses the generated Proto files to create Go code for the gRPC service
3. **Install Go Dependencies**: Installs all required Go dependencies for your plugin
4. **Build Binaries**: Compiles the plugin for one or more platform-architecture combinations

If you only want to generate code but not compile the binary (useful when you're updating your GraphQL schema), you can use the `--generate-only` flag.

## Required Tools

The build command will automatically check for and install the necessary toolchain (like protoc, protoc-gen-go, etc.) when required tools can't be found in the right version on your system. You can control this behavior with the `--skip-tools-installation` and `--force-tools-installation` flags.

For debugging your plugin, use the `--debug` flag to build with debug symbols. This enables debugging with tools like Delve, GoLand, or VS Code. See the [debugging guide](./debug) for detailed instructions.

You can also install the dependencies manually and use an IDE with Go support. The following table shows the current versions and download links for the required tools:

| Tool | Version | Installation Link |
|------|---------|---------------|
| Go | >=1.22.0 (Last 2 versions) | [Releases](https://go.dev/doc/install) |
| Protocol Buffers (protoc) | ^29.3 | [Releases](https://protobuf.dev/installation/) |
| protoc-gen-go | ^1.34.2 | [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf-go/releases) |
| protoc-gen-go-grpc | ^1.5.1 | [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/releases) |

## Examples

### Build for the current platform

```bash
wgc router plugin build ./my-plugin
```

### Generate code only

```bash
wgc router plugin build --generate-only ./my-plugin
```

### Build for multiple platforms

```bash
wgc router plugin build --platform darwin-arm64 linux-amd64 ./my-plugin
```

### Build for all supported platforms

```bash
wgc router plugin build --all-platforms ./my-plugin
```

## Supported Platforms

The following platform-architecture combinations are supported:

| Platform | Description | When to use |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| `linux-amd64` | Linux on 64-bit Intel/AMD processors | Most Linux servers, including AWS EC2, Google Cloud, Azure VMs |
| `linux-arm64` | Linux on 64-bit ARM processors | ARM-based servers, AWS Graviton instances, Raspberry Pi 4 |
| `darwin-amd64` | macOS on Intel processors | Intel-based Mac development machines |
| `darwin-arm64` | macOS on Apple Silicon (M1/M2) | Apple Silicon Mac development machines |
| `windows-amd64` | Windows on 64-bit Intel/AMD processors | Windows servers or development machines |

When using the `--all-platforms` flag, binaries for all of the above platforms will be built.

## Output

The build process creates several outputs:

- Generated Go code in the `generated/` directory
- Compiled binaries in the `bin/` directory, named according to the target platform (e.g., `my-plugin-darwin-arm64`, `my-plugin-linux-amd64`)

After building, you can configure the Cosmo Router to use your plugin by referencing the appropriate binary in your router configuration.

<Warning>
Ensure that the platform of your built plugin matches the platform where your Cosmo Router runs. For example, if you build your plugin on a Mac (darwin-arm64) but deploy your router on Linux (linux-amd64), you'll need to specify `--platform linux-amd64` during the build process. Using an incompatible plugin binary will result in runtime errors when the router attempts to load the plugin.
</Warning>
