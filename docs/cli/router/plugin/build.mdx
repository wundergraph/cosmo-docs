# wgc router plugin build

The `build` command generates gRPC code based on your GraphQL schema and compiles your plugin into platform-specific binaries.

## Usage

```bash
wgc router plugin build [options] [directory]
```

## Arguments

| Argument | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `directory` | Directory of the plugin | `.` (current directory) |

## Options

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `--generate-only` | Generate only the proto and mapping files, do not compile the plugin | `false` |
| `--go-module-path <path>` | Go module path to use for the plugin | `github.com/wundergraph/cosmo/plugin` |
| `--debug` | Build the binary with debug information for use with debuggers | `false` |
| `--platform [platforms...]` | Platform-architecture combinations (e.g., darwin-arm64 linux-amd64) | Host platform |
| `--all-platforms` | Build for all supported platforms | `false` |
| `--skip-tools-installation` | Skip tool installation | `false` |
| `--force-tools-installation` | Force tools installation regardless of version check or confirmation | `false` |

## Description

This command performs several steps to build your plugin:

1. **Generate Proto and Mapping Files**: Processes your GraphQL schema to generate Protocol Buffers definitions and mapping files
2. **Generate gRPC Code**: Uses the generated Proto files to create Go code for the gRPC service
3. **Install Go Dependencies**: Installs all required Go dependencies for your plugin
4. **Build Binaries**: Compiles the plugin for one or more platform-architecture combinations

If you only want to generate code but not compile the binary (useful when you're updating your GraphQL schema), you can use the `--generate-only` flag.

<Tip>
The build command will automatically check for and install the necessary toolchain (like protoc, protoc-gen-go, etc.) when required tools can't be found on your system. You can control this behavior with the `--skip-tools-installation` and `--force-tools-installation` flags.

For debugging your plugin, use the `--debug` flag to build with debug symbols. This enables debugging with tools like Delve, GoLand, or VS Code. See the [debugging guide](./debug) for detailed instructions.

**Platform Compatibility**: The target platform for your plugin must match the platform where the Cosmo Router is running. For example, if your router runs on a Linux AMD64 server, your plugin must be built for `linux-amd64`. When no platform is specified, the command uses your local machine's platform (the host platform) by default.
</Tip>

## Examples

### Build for the current platform

```bash
wgc router plugin build ./my-plugin
```

### Generate code only

```bash
wgc router plugin build --generate-only ./my-plugin
```

### Build for multiple platforms

```bash
wgc router plugin build --platform darwin-arm64 linux-amd64 ./my-plugin
```

### Build for all supported platforms

```bash
wgc router plugin build --all-platforms ./my-plugin
```

## Supported Platforms

The following platform-architecture combinations are supported:

| Platform | Description | When to use |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| `linux-amd64` | Linux on 64-bit Intel/AMD processors | Most Linux servers, including AWS EC2, Google Cloud, Azure VMs |
| `linux-arm64` | Linux on 64-bit ARM processors | ARM-based servers, AWS Graviton instances, Raspberry Pi 4 |
| `darwin-amd64` | macOS on Intel processors | Intel-based Mac development machines |
| `darwin-arm64` | macOS on Apple Silicon (M1/M2) | Apple Silicon Mac development machines |
| `windows-amd64` | Windows on 64-bit Intel/AMD processors | Windows servers or development machines |

When using the `--all-platforms` flag, binaries for all of the above platforms will be built.

## Output

The build process creates several outputs:

- Generated Go code in the `generated/` directory
- Compiled binaries in the `bin/` directory, named according to the target platform (e.g., `my-plugin-darwin-arm64`, `my-plugin-linux-amd64`)

After building, you can configure the Cosmo Router to use your plugin by referencing the appropriate binary in your router configuration.

<Warning>
Ensure that the platform of your built plugin matches the platform where your Cosmo Router runs. For example, if you build your plugin on a Mac (darwin-arm64) but deploy your router on Linux (linux-amd64), you'll need to specify `--platform linux-amd64` during the build process. Using an incompatible plugin binary will result in runtime errors when the router attempts to load the plugin.
