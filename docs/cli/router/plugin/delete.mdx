## Usage

```bash
npx wgc router plugin delete <name> [-f, --force]
```

<Note>
  **Delete** is an irreversible action. However, the change will only be visible
  to the routers once the composition has been successful. Until then, the
  routers will operate with the most recent valid composition. Please use
  [subgraph check](/cli/subgraph/check) to understand the impact of your change.
</Note>

## Description

The `npx wgc router plugin delete` command allows you to delete a plugin subgraph on the Cosmo platform's control plane. When you delete a plugin subgraph, all associated data and configurations will be permanently removed. Use this command with caution, as the action cannot be undone.

## Parameters

- `<name>`: The name of the plugin subgraph you want to delete. This should be the exact name of the plugin subgraph you wish to remove.

## Options

- `-n, --namespace` : The namespace of the plugin subgraph (Default: "default").

- `-f, --force`: An optional flag that allows you to force delete the plugin subgraph without being prompted for confirmation. Use this option if you want to delete the plugin subgraph without additional prompts.

- `--suppress-warnings`: This flag suppresses any warnings produced by composition.

## Examples

1. Delete the plugin subgraph named "projects":

   ```bash
   npx wgc router plugin delete projects
   ```

2. Force delete the plugin subgraph named "projects" without confirmation:

   ```bash
   npx wgc router plugin delete projects -f
   ```

3. Delete a plugin subgraph in a specific namespace:

   ```bash
   npx wgc router plugin delete projects -n production
   ```

## Notes

- The `npx wgc router plugin delete` command interacts with the Cosmo platform's control plane to delete the specified plugin subgraph.

- When using the `--force` option, the command will not prompt for confirmation, so exercise caution to prevent accidental data loss.

- If composition errors occur during deletion, the plugin subgraph will still be deleted, but the router will continue to work with the latest valid schema until the composition issues are resolved.
