# wgc router plugin test

The `test` command runs tests for your gRPC router plugin to verify its functionality.

## Usage

```bash
wgc router plugin test [options] [directory]
```

## Arguments

| Argument | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `directory` | Directory of the plugin | `.` (current directory) |

## Options

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `--skip-tools-installation` | Skip tool installation | `false` |
| `--force-tools-installation` | Force tools installation regardless of version check or confirmation | `false` |

## Description

This command runs the tests for your plugin. For Go plugins, it executes the Go test runner against the test files in your source directory.

<Tip>
The test command will automatically check for and install the necessary toolchain (like protoc, protoc-gen-go, etc.) when required tools can't be found on your system. You can control this behavior with the `--skip-tools-installation` and `--force-tools-installation` flags.
</Tip>

The test command will:

1. Check and install required tools if needed
2. Run Go tests in the `src` directory
3. Report the test results

Testing your plugin is an important step to ensure that your resolvers work correctly before deploying the plugin to your router.

## Test File

When you initialize a new plugin with `wgc router plugin init`, a test file is automatically created at `src/main_test.go`. This file includes a basic test setup that you can expand with your own test cases.

The default test file tests the plugin's ability to handle basic GraphQL queries. You should add additional tests to cover your custom resolver logic.

## Examples

### Run tests for a plugin

```bash
wgc router plugin test ./my-plugin
```

## Best Practices

When writing tests for your gRPC plugin:

1. **Test all resolvers**: Make sure to create test cases for all your GraphQL resolvers
2. **Test edge cases**: Include tests for error conditions and edge cases
3. **Mock dependencies**: If your plugin interacts with external systems, use mocks in your tests
4. **Test arguments**: Verify that your resolvers correctly handle different argument values
5. **Benchmark performance**: Add benchmarks for performance-critical resolvers

By thoroughly testing your plugin, you can ensure it behaves correctly when integrated with the Cosmo Router.
