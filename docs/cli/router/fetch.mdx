## Description

The `npx wgc router fetch` command allows you to fetch the latest valid router execution config of a federated graph from the Cosmo platform's control plane. The config can be piped into a file, which the router can read with the `EXECUTION_CONFIG_FILE_PATH` environment variable or via yaml config

```bash
execution_config:
  file:
    # Path to the previous generated file
    path: "router.json"
```

## Parameters

- `<name>`: The name of the federated graph for which you want to retrieve the router config.

## Options

- `-n, --namespace` : The namespace of the federated graph (Default: "default").

- `-o, --out` : Destination file for the router config. Prints to standard output if not provided.

## Examples

Fetch the latest router execution config of the federated graph named "production."

```bash
npx wgc router fetch production -o router.json
```

Fetch the latest router config of the federated graph named `production` and save it to a file named `router.json`
