## Description

The `npx wgc router token create` command creates a new token for a federated graph. The token can be used to authenticate against the control plane from the routers.

## Parameters

- `<name>`: The name of the token to create. Only serves as a reference for the user.

## Required Options

-g <graphName>, --graph-name <graphName>
```

The name of the federated graph that the token should be created for.

## Options

`-n, --namespace` : The namespace of the federated graph (Default: "default").

## Examples

npx wgc router token create graphToken -g production
```

Create a new token named "graphToken" for the federated graph named "production". The token is displayed once in the CLI. Pass the token as an environment variable to the router [configuration](/router/configuration).

## Notes

- The token is only valid for a specific federated graph.
