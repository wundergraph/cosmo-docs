## **The Cosmo stack**

  <Card title="CLI" icon="terminal" href="/cli/intro" >
   The Cosmo command line interface, referred to as `wgc`, plays a crucial role in managing the Cosmo platform. Its functions include pushing schemas, validating schemas, initiating new projects, and managing users, among others. It communicates directly with the Control Plane to perform these operations.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Control Plane" icon="server" href="/control-plane/intro">
  The Control Plane forms the heart of the Cosmo platform and comprises two core elements: The Platform API and the Node API. The Platform API is utilized by the Cosmo CLI tool and Studio for platform management. On the other hand, the Node API facilitates fleet-specific operations, carried out by the Router nodes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Router" icon="router" href="/router/intro">
  The Router is the component that understands the GraphQL Federation protocol. It is responsible for routing requests to the correct subgraphs and for aggregating the responses. While it maintains a connection with the Control Plane, its operation is independent and does not depend on the Control Plane's functionality for maximum availability.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Studio" icon="microphone-lines" href="/studio/intro">
  The Studio serves as the web interface for the Cosmo platform, providing a user-friendly medium for platform management and collaboration on GraphQL Federation. It maintains a connection with the Control Plane through the admin API, enabling efficient platform management.
