title: "Cosmo"
icon: door-open
description: "One of the key distinctions between WunderGraph Cosmo and other platforms, such as Apollo GraphOS, is the capability to manage and deploy the entire platform as a self-hosted version. In this scenario, you are responsible for maintaining the stack, and you gain full data sovereignty."
---

To make this manageable, we provide a production-grade Helm Chart, which allows you to deploy Cosmo to any Kubernetes service, including EKS, AKS, and GKE. Furthermore, you can also deploy to [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/) what we do for testing in development or CI.

In the next sections, we will explain the different deployment options.

<Info>
  Setting up Cosmo for optimal maintenance and scalability involves understanding its components. Ongoing maintenance is another critical factor to operate such a platform successfully. Without assistance, your team may use valuable time that could otherwise be devoted to your business activities. We strongly advise [reaching out to us](https://wundergraph.com/contact/sales) for the best configuration and deployment support.
