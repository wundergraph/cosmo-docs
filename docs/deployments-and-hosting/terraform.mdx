# Terraform Provider for Cosmo

Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that enables you to safely and predictably create, change, and improve infrastructure. With the Cosmo Terraform provider, you can manage your Cosmo Cloud resources programmatically, ensuring consistent and repeatable deployments.

## Installation

To get started with Terraform, you'll need to install it first. Please follow the [official installation guide](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli) for detailed instructions.


## Provider Configuration

To use the Cosmo provider, you'll need to configure it in your Terraform configuration. Here's a basic example:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    cosmo = {
      source = "wundergraph/cosmo"
      version = "~> 0.4.1"
    }
  }
}

provider "cosmo" {
  api_key = var.api_key
}
```

You can find complete examples in the [examples](https://github.com/wundergraph/terraform-provider-cosmo/tree/main/examples) directory.


## Why Use Terraform with Cosmo?

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Define your Cosmo Cloud infrastructure using declarative configuration files
- **Version Control**: Track changes to your infrastructure in version control
- **Automation**: Automate the provisioning and management of Cosmo resources
- **Consistency**: Ensure consistent deployments across different environments
