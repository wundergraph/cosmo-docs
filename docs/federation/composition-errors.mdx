## Enum was used as both an input and output but was inconsistently defined across inclusive subgraphs

When you get an error like `Enum X was used as both an input and output but was inconsistently defined across inclusive subgraphs` that means that you are publishing a change to an enum that is used in more than one subgraph.

When pushing the change to a single subgraph, you could generate situations of incompatibilities (think about this: if you return an enum value that the other subgraph accepts as an input, both subgraphs should know about it!).

To solve this issue you should proceed as follows:
- in the origin graph, adds @inaccessible to Enum.NewValue
- in each other graph that defines the enum, defines Enum.NewValue (no directive)
- after you have published the change to all the subgraphs that need that enum, remove @inaccessible from the origin graph and publish the change

Doing it in this way will always guarantee that the contract is respected in all the phases.

An easier way would be to publish the changes in all the subgraphs, ignoring the composition errors.
