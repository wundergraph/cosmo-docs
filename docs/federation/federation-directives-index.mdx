This page lists the GraphQL Federation directives currently supported by WunderGraph Cosmo. Each entry includes a brief description. For usage details, see the directiveâ€™s documentation or related federation guides.

Requires a subject and provider ID.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | ```graphql type Mutation {   updateUser(id: ID!): edfs__PublishResult! @edfs__natsPublish(subject: "user.updated") } ```                                                                                                |

Used in EDG Query fields.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | ``` type Query {   fetchUser(id: ID!): User! @edfs__natsRequest(subject: "user.fetch") } ```                                                                                                                            |
| [`@edfs__natsSubscribe`](/federation/event-driven-federation/nats)                       | Marks a subscription field that listens to one or more NATS subjects. Can include stream configuration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | ```graphql type Subscription {   userUpdated: User! @edfs__natsSubscribe(subjects: ["user.updated"]) } ```                                                                                                              |
| `@external`                                                                              | Marks a field as coming from another subgraph in a federated GraphQL schema. The field exists on the base type in a different subgraph and is not resolved by the current one, but it can be referenced if needed by directives or to satisfy an interface. In addition to indicating data ownership, `@external` is used in several advanced scenarios: to satisfy an interface implementation, to reference a field that may be conditionally provided via `@provides`, or to declare a dependency used by `@requires`.                                                                                                                                                                                                          | ```graphql type Product @key(fields: "id") {   id: ID!   weight: Float @external } ```                                                                                                                                  |
| `@extends`                                                                               | Marks an object or interface as an extension of a type that is defined in another subgraph, typically when the subgraph's GraphQL implementation does not support the `extend` keyword. This directive is mainly used by subgraph servers that lack native support for type extensions. In Federation v2, this is no longer required to mark entity types as extensions. Any subgraph can contribute fields to an entity without declaring it as an extension. In Federation v1, each entity had an originating subgraph, and any other subgraph referencing that entity was required to use the `extend` keyword. The `@extends` directive remains in use primarily for backward compatibility and edge cases in tooling support. | ```graphql type Product @extends @key(fields: "id") {   id: ID! @external   inStock: Boolean! } ```                                                                                                                     |
| `@inaccessible`                                                                          | Hides a field or type from the client schema. It cannot be queried by the user, but the planner may still access it if used in a `@key`, `@requires`, or `@provides` directive. Types marked as inaccessible are excluded from unions and interfaces.

This means the field can be resolved from more than one subgraph, and the query planner decides which one to use.
