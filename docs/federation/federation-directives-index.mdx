This page lists the GraphQL Federation directives that WunderGraph Cosmo supports. Each entry includes a brief description. For usage details, see the directive’s documentation or related federation guides.

| Directive                        | Explanation                                                                                                                                        |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`@authenticated`](/federation/directives/authenticated)                 | Marks a field or type as requiring authentication. Only requests with valid credentials can access it.                                             |
| `@composeDirective` (planned)    | Tells the composition process to preserve a specific custom type system directive in the supergraph.                                               |
| [`@edfs__kafkaPublish`](/federation/event-driven-federation/kafka)            | Marks a mutation field that publishes an event to a Kafka topic. Requires a topic and provider ID.                                                 |
| [`@edfs__kafkaSubscribe`](/federation/event-driven-federation/kafka)          | Declares a subscription field that listens to one or more Kafka topics. Used in EDG Subscription fields.                                           |
| [`@edfs__natsPublish`](/federation/event-driven-federation/nats)             | Marks a mutation field that publishes an event to a NATS subject. Requires a subject and provider ID.                                              |
| [`@edfs__natsRequest`](/federation/event-driven-federation/nats)             | Declares a query field that requests an event over NATS and expects a response. Used in EDG Query fields.                                          |
| [`@edfs__natsSubscribe`](/federation/event-driven-federation/nats)           | Marks a subscription field that listens to one or more NATS subjects. Can include stream configuration.                                            |
| `@external`                      | Indicates that a field (or all fields of a type) comes from another subgraph and isn’t resolved here.                                              |
| `@extends`                       | Marks an object or interface as an extension of a type defined in another subgraph, when `extend` isn’t used.                                      |
| `@inaccessible`                  | Hides a field or type from the API schema while keeping it in the supergraph for internal use.                                                     |
| `@interfaceObject`               | Lets a subgraph contribute fields to an interface and all implementing types by defining an object abstraction.                                    |
| `@key`                           | Declares one or more fields that uniquely identify an entity across subgraphs, enabling resolution.                                                |
| `@link`                          | Connects an external spec to the schema and optionally imports types or directives for use in the subgraph.                                        |
| [`@openfed__configureDescription`](/federation/directives/openfed__configuredescription) | Allows controlling how and whether descriptions are propagated to the federated schema. Supports overrides, hiding, and composition on extensions. |
| [`@openfed__subscriptionFilter`](/federation/directives/openfed__subscriptionfilter)   | Applies a filter condition to a subscription field, restricting events based on field values or logical expressions.                               |
| `@override`                      | Specifies that a field now resolves from the current subgraph instead of the one that previously defined it.                                       |
| `@provides`                      | Indicates that specific fields can be resolved from this subgraph, but only at certain schema paths.                                               |
| `@requires`                      | Declares that a field’s resolver depends on other fields from a different subgraph that must be fetched first.                                     |
| [`@requiresScopes`](/federation/directives/requiresscopes)                | Restricts access to schema elements based on JWT scopes, enabling fine-grained authorization policies.                                             |
| [`@shareable`](/federation/directives/shareable)                     | Marks a field or type as safe to define in multiple subgraphs. Allows shared resolution responsibilities.                                          |
| `@tag`                           | Attaches custom metadata to schema elements, used by tooling (e.g., contracts, filters, analysis).                                                 |
