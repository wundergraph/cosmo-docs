| [`@edfs__natsPublish`](/federation/event-driven-federation/nats)                         | Marks a mutation field that publishes an event to a NATS subject. Requires a subject and provider ID.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [`@edfs__natsRequest`](/federation/event-driven-federation/nats)                         | Declares a query field that requests an event over NATS and expects a response. Used in EDG Query fields.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [`@edfs__natsSubscribe`](/federation/event-driven-federation/nats)                       | Marks a subscription field that listens to one or more NATS subjects. Can include stream configuration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `@external`                                                                              | Marks a field as coming from another subgraph in a federated GraphQL schema. The field exists on the base type in a different subgraph and is not resolved by the current one, but it can be referenced if needed by directives or to satisfy an interface. In addition to indicating data ownership, `@external` is used in several advanced scenarios: to satisfy an interface implementation, to reference a field that may be conditionally provided via `@provides`, or to declare a dependency used by `@requires`.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `@extends`                                                                               | Marks an object or interface as an extension of a type that is defined in another subgraph, typically when the subgraph's GraphQL implementation does not support the `extend` keyword. This directive is mainly used by subgraph servers that lack native support for type extensions. In Federation v2, this is no longer required to mark entity types as extensions. Any subgraph can contribute fields to an entity without declaring it as an extension. In Federation v1, each entity had an originating subgraph, and any other subgraph referencing that entity was required to use the `extend` keyword. The `@extends` directive remains in use primarily for backward compatibility and edge cases in tooling support. |
| `@inaccessible`                                                                          | Hides a field or type from the client schema. It cannot be queried by the user, but the planner may still access it if used in a `@key`, `@requires`, or `@provides` directive. Types marked as inaccessible are excluded from unions and interfaces. If the server returns one, the router will either return an error or render the object as null depending on the field’s nullability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `@interfaceObject`                                                                       | Used to mark a type that corresponds to an interface in another subgraph, where that interface has a `@key` directive. This kind of interface is referred to as an entity interface. The directive allows the subgraph to contribute fields to every type that implements the entity interface in the other subgraph. When using `@interfaceObject`, the same subgraph must not define any of the implementing types, or it will result in a composition error.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `@key`                                                                                   | Declares one or more fields that uniquely identify an entity across subgraphs. It has two arguments. The `fields` argument is of type `fieldSet`, which represents a GraphQL selection set with omitted curly braces `{}`. The `resolvable` argument defaults to true. If `resolvable` is set to false, the subgraph will not be used to resolve fields for that entity, because it does not implement the entity reference resolver for the given key. The only exception is when one of the fields uses the `@requires` directive, and in that case, the planner may still route a query to the subgraph, but only the field resolver will run, not the entity reference resolver.                                               |
| `@link`                                                                                  | Used to reference an external specification and optionally import types or directives into a subgraph schema.

The fields listed in the `fields` argument must be marked as `@external`. If a parent field of a nested external field is marked as `@external`, and there are sibling fields that are not external, those sibling fields will also be available for resolution on the parent external path.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

The `fields` argument is of type `fieldSet`. Required fields are not fetched until the necessary data is retrieved from the other subgraph. These fields are then passed along with key values in the representation variables.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| [`@shareable`](/federation/directives/shareable)                                         | Marks a field or type as safe to define in multiple subgraphs. This means the field can be resolved from more than one subgraph, and the query planner decides which one to use. If all options are equal, the planner will choose the first subgraph based on their order of appearance. If the shared field is a root query field and its return type defines different fields across subgraphs, both fields will be queried and merged. However, this pattern is discouraged because subgraphs are then responsible for maintaining data integrity. In general, shareable fields are expected to return the same value regardless of which subgraph resolves them. Key fields are shareable by default.                         |
