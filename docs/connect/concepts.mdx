## Concepts

Cosmo Connect extends GraphQL Federation with support for **gRPC integration**.
Instead of running backend GraphQL servers, you define a schema contract that describes how clients interact with your services.
From this schema, the router can generate the corresponding Protocol Buffer files automatically, which your services then implement.
This makes it possible to connect gRPC or other existing systems directly into your federated graph.

Cosmo Connect makes it possible to keep the external API GraphQL-shaped while backend services remain free to use simpler request–response contracts.

## How It Works

- Define a GraphQL schema that represents the API contract  
- Define the corresponding Protobuf files 
- Implement the gRPC methods in your services  
- Configure the router so queries are executed through gRPC  

## Integration Options

Cosmo Connect provides two integration models:

- **Router Plugins** — run as separate local processes managed by the router, giving you simple deployment without a separate subgraph service
- **gRPC Services** — run as independent deployments in any language, with full control over scaling and ownership  

Both approaches extend the federated graph without requiring backend GraphQL servers, letting you choose between in-router simplicity and independent scaling.
