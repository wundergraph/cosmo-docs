## Cosmo Connect

Cosmo Connect extends GraphQL Federation with support for **gRPC integration**.  
Instead of running backend GraphQL servers, teams define a schema contract that describes how clients interact with services. From this schema, the Cosmo Router can generate Protocol Buffer files, which your backend services then implement.  

This approach keeps the external API GraphQL-shaped while backend services remain free to use **simple request–response contracts** through gRPC. The router transparently maps GraphQL queries into RPC calls while preserving a unified supergraph.


## We adopt to two deployment models

Cosmo Connect provides two options for integrating gRPC into your federated graph:

- **[Router Plugins](/connect/plugins)** — run as local processes managed by the router. Ideal for simple deployments where you want the lowest latency and do not need separate CI/CD or scaling.  
- **[gRPC Services](/connect/grpc-services)** — independent deployments in any language. Suitable when you need full lifecycle control, team ownership boundaries, and independent scaling.

Both approaches remove the need to build GraphQL servers while maintaining the benefits of federation.

## Key Benefits

- **Federation without GraphQL servers** — backend teams implement gRPC contracts instead of GraphQL resolvers  
- **Language flexibility** — leverage gRPC code generation across nearly all ecosystems, including those with poor GraphQL server libraries  
- **Reduced migration effort** — wrap existing APIs (like REST or SOAP) without writing full subgraphs, lowering the cost of moving from monoliths to federation  
- **Developer experience** — simple request/response semantics for services, while the router handles GraphQL query planning and batching 

## Implementation Docs

The following documentation explains how to build and deploy both services and plugins:

- **[Router Plugins](/router/grpc/plugins)** — Documentation for developing, configuring, and deploying plugins that run inside the router  
- **[gRPC Services](/router/grpc/grpc-services)** — Documentation for the complete lifecycle of building, deploying, and managing independent gRPC services  

These docs assume you're familiar with the concepts above and are ready to implement your first service or plugin.

## Getting Started

The following tutorials walk you through step-by-step examples of building your first integration. 
Unlike the implementation docs, which cover the full technical reference, these focus on quick setup and hands-on learning:
