## Cosmo Connect

Cosmo Connect extends GraphQL Federation beyond GraphQL by supporting **gRPC-based services**.  
With Connect, backend teams no longer need to implement GraphQL servers. Instead, they define request–response contracts using gRPC, and the Cosmo Router translates GraphQL queries into gRPC calls while maintaining a unified GraphQL API.

<Note>
Cosmo Connect is a new feature. Some functionality and configuration options may evolve as the feature matures. Refer to the latest router documentation for the most up-to-date information.

## Overview

Cosmo Connect provides two integration models for extending federated graphs:

- **Router Plugins** — run as separate local processes managed by the router, giving you the simplest deployment model without needing to stand up a separate subgraph service  
- **gRPC Services** — run as independent deployments in any language, with full control over scaling and ownership  

Both approaches eliminate the need for backend GraphQL servers while preserving the benefits of federation.

## Key Components

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Plugins" icon="plug" href="/connect/plugins">
    Extensions that run alongside the router as local processes. Ideal for simple integrations where you don’t need independent scaling or CI/CD pipelines.
  </Card>
  <Card title="gRPC Services" icon="network-wired" href="/connect/grpc-services">
    Independent services with full lifecycle control. Suitable for distributed teams, complex business logic, and multi-language environments.

## When to Use Connect

### Use Plugins When
- You want the **simplest deployment model**  
- **Performance** is critical (lowest latency)  
- Unified deployment with the router is acceptable  

### Use gRPC Services When
- You need **independent scaling** and deployment pipelines  
- Teams use **languages other than Go**  
- Services are owned by **different teams** with separate lifecycles  
- You want to maintain a distributed architecture
