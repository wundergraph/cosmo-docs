## Cosmo Connect

Cosmo Connect gives you the power of GraphQL as your design language—without requiring backend teams to commit to GraphQL servers frameworks.

You define a GraphQL schema contract that specifies the service interface. From this contract, Cosmo Connect generates Protocol Buffer definitions and language-specific stubs, enabling you to implement your service or plugin in the technology of your choice.

This approach ensures full GraphQL Federation support while empowering backend teams to keep building with the tools and workflows they know best. By simply bridging their services into the supergraph with Cosmo Connect, every team contributes seamlessly — no matter the language, framework, or architecture. In turn, **every service becomes part of the supergraph**, unlocking new opportunities through unified data access, centralized governance, and deeper collaboration across the company.

## Key benefits

* **All Cosmo platform benefits** — including breaking change detection, centralized telemetry, and governance out of the box
* **Federation without GraphQL servers** — backend teams implement gRPC contracts instead of GraphQL resolvers
* **Language flexibility** — leverage gRPC code generation across nearly all ecosystems, including those with poor GraphQL server libraries
* **Reduced migration effort** — wrap existing APIs (like REST or SOAP) without writing full subgraphs, lowering the cost of moving from monoliths to federation
* **Developer experience** — straightforward request/response semantics, with the router handling GraphQL query planning and batching

## We support two deployment models

Cosmo Connect supports two ways to integrate gRPC into your federated graph:

- **[Router Plugins](/connect/plugins)** — run as local processes managed by the router. Ideal for simple deployments where you want the lowest latency and do not need separate CI/CD or scaling.  
- **[gRPC Services](/connect/grpc-services)** — independent deployments in any language. Suitable when you need full lifecycle control, team ownership boundaries, and independent scaling.

Both approaches remove the need to build GraphQL servers while maintaining the benefits of federation.

## Implementation Docs

The following documentation explains how to build and deploy services and plugins:

- **[Router Plugins](/router/grpc/plugins)** — Documentation for developing, configuring, and deploying plugins that run inside the router  
- **[gRPC Services](/router/grpc/grpc-services)** — Documentation for the complete lifecycle of building, deploying, and managing independent gRPC services  

These docs assume you're familiar with the concepts above and are ready to implement your first service or plugin.

## Getting Started

The following tutorials walk you through step-by-step examples of building your first integration. 
Unlike the implementation docs, which cover the full technical reference, these focus on quick setup and hands-on learning:
