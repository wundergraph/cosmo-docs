# Cosmo Connect

Cosmo Connect extends GraphQL Federation beyond GraphQL by supporting **gRPC and RPC-style services**.  
With Connect, backend teams no longer need to implement GraphQL servers. Instead, they expose request–response contracts using gRPC, and the Cosmo Router translates GraphQL queries into gRPC calls while maintaining a unified GraphQL API.

<Note>
Cosmo Connect is a new feature. Some functionality and configuration options may evolve as the feature matures. Refer to the latest router documentation for the most up-to-date information.

## Overview

Cosmo Connect provides two integration patterns for extending federated graphs:

- **Plugins** — Local extensions that run as separate processes managed by the router. They provide the **simplest deployment model** with the **highest performance**.  
- **gRPC Services** — Independent, remotely deployed services. They provide **full deployment control** and **language flexibility** across any gRPC-supported ecosystem.

Both approaches eliminate the need for backend GraphQL servers while preserving the benefits of federation.

    Local extensions managed by the router. Ideal for simple integrations and performance-critical paths.

  <Card title="gRPC Services" icon="network-wired" href="/connect/grpc-services">
    Independent services with full lifecycle control. Suitable for distributed teams, complex business logic, and multi-language environments.

## Benefits

### For Backend Teams
- **Simplified contracts** — schema-driven, request–response instead of GraphQL complexity  
- **Language flexibility** — implement services in any gRPC-supported language  
- **Team independence** — services and plugins can be owned and deployed separately  

### For Frontend Teams
- **Unified API** — single GraphQL endpoint across all services  
- **Familiar interface** — standard GraphQL queries and mutations  
- **Type safety** — generated types from the federated schema  

### For Operations
- **Lifecycle management** — router handles plugin hot-reloading and service discovery  
- **Fault isolation** — plugins run in separate processes; services run remotely  
- **Scalability** — choose between local plugins and independently scaled services  

## When to Use Connect

### Use Plugins When
- You want the **simplest deployment model**  
- **Performance** is critical (lowest latency)  
- Teams are comfortable with Go development  
- Unified deployment with the router is acceptable  

### Use gRPC Services When
- You need **independent scaling** and deployment pipelines  
- Teams use **languages other than Go**  
- Services are owned by **different teams** with separate lifecycles  
- You want to maintain a distributed microservices architecture
