## Cosmo Connect

Cosmo Connect gives you the power of GraphQL as your design language while removing the need to run GraphQL servers.

You define a GraphQL schema contract that specifies the service interface. From this contract, we generate Protocol Buffer definitions and language-specific stubs that you can use to implement your plugin or service.

This approach makes the service fully GraphQL Federation compliant, while allowing backend services to remain free of any GraphQL framework or technology by simply leveraging straightforward gRPC.

## We adopt to two deployment models

Cosmo Connect provides two options for integrating gRPC into your federated graph:

- **[Router Plugins](/connect/plugins)** — run as local processes managed by the router. Ideal for simple deployments where you want the lowest latency and do not need separate CI/CD or scaling.  
- **[gRPC Services](/connect/grpc-services)** — independent deployments in any language. Suitable when you need full lifecycle control, team ownership boundaries, and independent scaling.

Both approaches remove the need to build GraphQL servers while maintaining the benefits of federation.

## Key Benefits

- **Federation without GraphQL servers** — backend teams implement gRPC contracts instead of GraphQL resolvers  
- **Language flexibility** — leverage gRPC code generation across nearly all ecosystems, including those with poor GraphQL server libraries  
- **Reduced migration effort** — wrap existing APIs (like REST or SOAP) without writing full subgraphs, lowering the cost of moving from monoliths to federation  
- **Developer experience** — simple request/response semantics for services, while the router handles GraphQL query planning and batching 

## Implementation Docs

The following documentation explains how to build and deploy both services and plugins:

- **[Router Plugins](/router/grpc/plugins)** — Documentation for developing, configuring, and deploying plugins that run inside the router  
- **[gRPC Services](/router/grpc/grpc-services)** — Documentation for the complete lifecycle of building, deploying, and managing independent gRPC services  

These docs assume you're familiar with the concepts above and are ready to implement your first service or plugin.

## Getting Started

The following tutorials walk you through step-by-step examples of building your first integration. 
Unlike the implementation docs, which cover the full technical reference, these focus on quick setup and hands-on learning:
