## Connect Plugins

Connect Plugins are part of Cosmo Connect.
They run as separate local processes managed by the router, providing the fastest path to integrating external APIs and services into your federated graph without requiring separate infrastructure or CI/CD pipelines—just publish through the Cosmo registry.

## Overview

Plugins extend the router’s federation functionality.
They are best suited for straightforward integrations that don’t require independent scaling or dedicated service management.

## When to Use Plugins

- **Simple integrations** with external APIs  
- **Lightweight services** that don’t need independent scaling  
- **Unified deployment** alongside the router  

## Comparing with gRPC Services

- **Plugins** — simplest deployment model and lowest latency, running as local processes managed by the router  
- **[gRPC Services](/connect/grpc-services)** — independent deployments with full scaling and lifecycle control
