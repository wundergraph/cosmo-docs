## gRPC Services

As part of Cosmo Connect, you can run gRPC services as independent processes that communicate with the router over the network.
Unlike plugins, which run as local processes managed by the router, gRPC services are deployed as fully independent microservices and can live anywhere in your infrastructure.

This model is a good fit when teams want service autonomy, need independent scaling, or use any gRPC-supported language.

## Why Use gRPC Services

gRPC services extend your federated graph while keeping service boundaries intact. They make it possible to:

- Build in any gRPC-supported language (such as Python, Java, Node.js, Rust)  
- Scale services independently based on workload  
- Manage lifecycles, monitoring, and releases per team  
- Run in distributed or multi-region environments  

## Comparing with Plugins

- **Use gRPC Services** when you need language flexibility, independent scaling, and distributed deployments  
- **Use [Plugins](/connect/plugins)** when you want the simplest deployment and the lowest latency
