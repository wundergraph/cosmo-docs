# gRPC Services

Cosmo Connect lets you run gRPC services as independent microservices that communicate with the router over the network. Unlike plugins, which run inside the router process, gRPC services are deployed separately and can live anywhere in your infrastructure.

This model is a good fit when teams want service autonomy, need independent scaling, or use languages other than Go.

<Note>
gRPC services are part of **Cosmo Connect**, enabling RPC-style integrations without requiring GraphQL servers.

## Why Use gRPC Services

gRPC services extend your federated graph while keeping service boundaries intact. They make it possible to:

- Build in any gRPC-supported language (Python, Java, Node.js, Rust, etc.)  
- Scale services independently based on workload  
- Manage lifecycles, monitoring, and releases per team  
- Run in distributed or multi-region environments  

## Comparing with Plugins

- **Choose gRPC Services** when you need language flexibility, separate deployment pipelines, or distributed architecture.  
- **Choose Plugins** when you want the lowest latency, simplest deployment, and are comfortable working in Go.
