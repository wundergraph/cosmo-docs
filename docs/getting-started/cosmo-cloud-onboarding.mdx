## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prerequisites">
    - If you don't have one, create a free account at https://cosmo.wundergraph.com/login.
    - You need to have [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (or higher), npm, and docker installed.
    - Curl is needed to download files.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Prepare your Organization">
    After signing up, a personal organization is automatically created for you. You can use this for the demo, but we recommend creating a separate organization once you complete the tutorial. To do this, open the organization dropdown, select **"Create a new organization",** and choose a relevant name and slug for your new organization.

    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install the CLI">
    Install the CLI to interact with the control plane and manage resources like graphs and API keys:

    ```bash
    npm install -g wgc@latest
    ```

    Log in with:

    ```bash
    wgc auth login
    ```

    This opens your browser and prompts you to sign into your Cosmo account. Once logged in, you'll receive a terminal prompt to select your organization.

    After logging in, verify your session and ensure you're in the correct organization by running:

    ```bash
    wgc auth whoami
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Create the Demo

### Create a Namespace

A namespace helps separate resources and prevents unintended modifications between environments. Namespaces can also be used to create isolated environments for better organization and management.

To create a **development** namespace, run:

```bash
wgc namespace create development
```

### Create a Federated Graph

A federated graph represents your unified, federated GraphQL schema. Each federated graph is assigned a URL and can be mapped to a single router instance.

For this demo, you’ll point to a demo router. The URL doesn’t need to be valid for the demo, but in a production environment, you would specify the URL of your deployed router.

Run the following command to create a federated graph:

```bash
wgc federated-graph create demo \
    --namespace development \
    --routing-url https://demo-router.fly.dev/graphql
```

The [CLI documentation](/cli/intro) provides detailed explanations of the parameters. If necessary, the parameters can be changed later.

### Create Subgraphs

A **federated graph** requires subgraphs to function. Without subgraphs, it cannot serve a valid GraphQL schema.

For this demo, you'll use pre-deployed demo subgraphs on a serverless platform. Follow the order below to ensure proper configuration:

<CardGroup cols="2">
  <Card title="Products" icon="square-1" horizontal>
    
  </Card>
  <Card title="Employee" icon="square-2" horizontal>
    
  </Card>
  <Card title="Mood" icon="square-3" horizontal>
    
  </Card>
  <Card title="Availability" icon="square-4" horizontal>
    
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Products">
    1. Create the subgraph:

    ```bash
    wgc subgraph create products \
        --namespace development \
        --routing-url https://product-api.fly.dev/graphql
    ```

    1. Download the schema and publish it:

    ```bash
    curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wundergraph/cosmo/refs/heads/main/demo/pkg/subgraphs/products/subgraph/schema.graphqls \
    && wgc subgraph publish products \
        --namespace development \
        --schema ./schema.graphqls
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Employee">
    1. Create the subgraph:

    ```bash
    wgc subgraph create employees \
        --namespace development \
        --routing-url https://employees-api.fly.dev/graphql
    ```

    1. Download the schema and publish it:

    <Warning>
      Expected Composition Errors
    </Warning>
    Before publishing, be aware that you will see errors indicating that the composition was unsuccessful. This is expected and will be resolved once the remaining subgraphs are published.

    Your router will never deploy an invalid composition. Instead, it will continue running the latest valid composition schema.

    <Frame>
      ![](/images/getting-started/image-4.png)
    </Frame>
    ```bash
    curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wundergraph/cosmo/refs/heads/main/demo/pkg/subgraphs/employees/subgraph/schema.graphqls \
    && wgc subgraph publish employees \
    --namespace development \
    --schema ./schema.graphqls
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Mood">
    1. Create the subgraph:

    ```bash
    wgc subgraph create mood \
        --namespace development \
        --routing-url https://mood-api.fly.dev/graphql
    ```

    1. Download the schema and publish it:

    ```bash
    curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wundergraph/cosmo/refs/heads/main/demo/pkg/subgraphs/mood/subgraph/schema.graphqls \
    && wgc subgraph publish mood \
        --namespace development \
        --schema ./schema.graphqls
    ```

    After publishing the Mood subgraph schema, several composition errors have been resolved. Next, publish the Availability subgraph.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Availability">
    1. Create the subgraph:

    ```bash
    wgc subgraph create availability \
        --namespace development \
      	--routing-url https://availability-api.fly.dev/graphql
    ```

    1. Download the schema and publish it:

    ```bash
    curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wundergraph/cosmo/refs/heads/main/demo/pkg/subgraphs/availability/subgraph/schema.graphqls \
    && wgc subgraph publish availability \
         --namespace development \
         --schema ./schema.graphqls
    ```

    After publishing the schema, there should be no composition errors. Your graph has been successfully composed and is now ready to be retrieved by the router.

    To verify, open the Cosmo Overview page for your graph.

      ![](/images/getting-started/image-5.png)
    </Frame>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Create a Router Token

After publishing all subgraphs, you need to generate a Router Token. This token allows the router to communicate with the control plane and fetch the latest valid graph composition.

Run the following command to create a router token:

```bash
wgc router token create myName \
    --graph-name demo \
    --namespace development
```

- Replace `myName` with a meaningful name for your token.
- The command returns a confirmation message and token, similar to:

  ```bash
  Successfully created token myName for graph demo
  
  <tokenhere>
  ```
- **Copy and store the token securely**, as it will not be shown again. You will need it in the next step.

### Run the Router

Finally, go to the **Overview** page of your federated graph in **Cosmo Cloud** and click **"Run Router Locally"** to copy the command needed to start the router.

Make sure to replace `<graph-api-token>` with the token you copied set in the previous step.

<Frame>
  ![](/images/getting-started/image-2.png)
</Frame>

Alternatively, you can use the following command:

```bash
docker run \
  --name cosmo-router \
  --rm \
  -p 3002:3002 \
  --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
  --pull always \
  -e DEV_MODE=true \
  -e LISTEN_ADDR=0.0.0.0:3002 \
  -e GRAPH_API_TOKEN="<graph-api-token>" \
  ghcr.io/wundergraph/cosmo/router:latest
```

### Open the Playground

Open [http://localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002) and run your first GraphQL operation with WunderGraph Cosmo\!  The same playground is also available on Cosmo Cloud.

### Example Query that involves all subgraphs

```bash
query myEmployees {
  employees {
    id
    products
    role {
      departments
    }
    details {
      forename
    }
    isAvailable
    currentMood
  }
}
```

#### <Icon icon="star" iconType="solid" /> Bonus

After executing the [Example Query](/getting-started/cosmo-cloud-onboarding#example-query-that-involves-all-subgraphs), use the dropdown on the right to see how the router processed the request and distributed it across subgraphs. Inspect the generated query plan to understand execution details, troubleshoot issues during development, and ensure optimal performance in production.

If you want to learn more about it, please take a look at [ART](/router/advanced-request-tracing-art) and [Query Plans](/router/query-plan).

## Prevent breaking changes

Each time you interact with the router, schema usage data is collected and centralized on our platform. This data helps you manage federation at scale and, more importantly, identify potential impacts on your customers before making changes.

To integrate this into your workflow, use the check command to assess the impact of any schema modifications.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Download the schema of the Employees subgraph">
    Run the following command to download the schema:

    ```bash
    curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wundergraph/cosmo/refs/heads/main/demo/pkg/subgraphs/employees/subgraph/schema.graphqls
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Locate and open the schema file">
    By default, the file is saved in your current working directory. Verify its location with:

    ```bash
    ls -l schema.graphqls
    ```

    If you need to search for the file, use:

    ```bash
    find ~ -name "schema.graphqls"
    ```

    Once you've located the file, open it in your preferred text editor modify it.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Modify the Schema and Run the Check Command">
    Remove the `OPERATIONS` enum value from the schema:

    ```bash
    enum Department {
      ENGINEERING
      MARKETING
      # OPERATIONS
    }
    ```

    Run the check command:

    ```bash
    wgc subgraph check employees \
        --namespace development \
        --schema ./schema.graphqls
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Breaking change detected with client usage">
    You should see an output similar to the following. The change is flagged as breaking because the `departments` field was queried in an example query, meaning its removal would impact existing clients.

    ```bash
    ❯ wgc subgraph check employees \
        --namespace development \
        --schema ./schema.graphqls
    
    Checking the proposed schema

    ```

    Click the `Open in studio` link to review the schema check in Cosmo Studio.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Release your changes">
    Once you're confident about the impact of your changes, publish them to automatically update your router fleet:

    ```bash
    wgc subgraph publish employees \
        --namespace development \
        --schema ./schema.graphqls
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Clean up

To remove all resources, delete the namespace with:

```bash
wgc namespace delete -f development
```
