## Configuration

To enable webhooks, configure the `WEBHOOK_URL` and `WEBHOOK_SECRET` environment variables. Once enabled, the URL specified will start receiving the following events:

## Platform Events

### `USER_REGISTER_SUCCESS`

Triggered whenever a user registration is successful.

- `user_id`: The unique identifier of the registered user.

- `user_email`: The email address of the registered user.

**Sample Payload:**

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "event": "USER_REGISTER_SUCCESS",
  "payload": {
    "user_id": "1234abcd",
    "user_email": "user@example.com"
  }
}
```

### `APOLLO_MIGRATE_INIT`

Triggered when graph migration is initiated.

`actor_id` (optional): The identifier of the actor initializing the migration

**Sample Payload:**

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "event": "APOLLO_MIGRATE_INIT",
  "payload": {
    "actor_id": "user5678"
  }
}
```

### `APOLLO_MIGRATE_SUCCESS`

Triggered when graph migration succeeds.

- `federated_graph`: An object representing the federated graph details.

  - `id`: The unique identifier of the federated graph.

  - `name`: The name of the federated graph.

- `actor_id` (optional): The identifier of the actor initializing the migration.

**Sample Payload:**

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "event": "GRAPH_MIGRATE_SUCCESS",
  "payload": {
    "federated_graph": {
      "id": "graph123",
      "name": "MainGraph",
      "namespace": "default"
    },
    "actor_id": "user5678"
  }
}
```

## Verification

To ensure the webhook data is coming from a trusted source and hasn't been tampered with during transit, we employ HMAC signatures. When setting up a webhook, you provide a secret. This secret is used to compute a signature that is sent along with each webhook request.

The header containing this signature is `X-Cosmo-Signature-256`.

#### Verification Example

To verify the webhook request, you need to compute the HMAC signature on your server and compare it to the signature in the `X-Cosmo-Signature-256` header.

Here's an example in Node.js:

```js
import crypto from "crypto";

function verifySignature(body, receivedSignature, secret) {
  const computedSignature = crypto
    .createHmac("sha256", secret)
    .update(body)
    .digest("hex");

  return computedSignature === receivedSignature;
}

// Usage:
const isVerified = verifySignature(
  JSON.stringify(req.body),
  req.headers["x-cosmo-signature-256"],
  YOUR_SECRET,
);
```
