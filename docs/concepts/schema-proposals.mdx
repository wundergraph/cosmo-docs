## Introduction

As your federated graph schema grows, managing schema changes becomes increasingly complex. Traditional approaches to schema change management often involve ad-hoc communication processes that lack visibility and traceability. Schema proposals provide a structured workflow for proposing, reviewing, and implementing schema changes in a collaborative manner.

Schema proposals enable teams to:

- Propose and track schema changes through a well-defined workflow
- Validate proposed changes against automated schema checks and linting rules
- Facilitate collaboration through reviewer feedback and approvals
- Create a comprehensive audit trail of schema changes
- Ensure only approved changes are published to production

By centralizing schema change management directly in the platform, teams can streamline development cycles and improve the quality of schema design decisions.

## How Schema Proposals Work

Schema proposals provide a systematic process for managing schema changes from conception to implementation. Team members create, review, and approve schema proposals, then implement the approved changes before publishing them to the graph.

**Note:** Schema proposals—even approved ones—don't automatically deploy any changes to your graph. Once a proposal is approved, your team must implement and publish the changes.

The schema proposal workflow follows these general steps:

1. **Create proposal**: A team member creates a proposal describing schema changes
2. **Request feedback**: The proposal is opened for review by relevant stakeholders
3. **Review and approve**: Reviewers provide feedback and approve the proposal when ready
4. **Implement changes**: The team implements the approved changes in code
5. **Publish schema**: The updated schema is published to the graph

## Proposal States

Schema proposals progress through several states that represent their position in the review and implementation workflow:

| State           | Description                                                                                                                                                             |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **DRAFT**       | The initial state of a newly created proposal.                                                          |
| **APPROVED**    | The proposal has been approved by the reviewers. The proposal is ready for implementation. Once a proposal is approved, proposals can no longer be updated. |
| **PUBLISHED**   | All changes in the proposal have been published. Implemented proposals can't receive further revisions or status updates.                                               |
| **CLOSED**      | The proposal has been closed. |


## Configuring Schema Proposals


## Conclusion

Schema proposals provide a structured approach to managing schema changes, improving collaboration between teams, and ensuring that changes follow established governance practices. By adopting schema proposals as part of your schema management process, you can increase the quality of schema design decisions while creating a comprehensive audit trail of schema evolution.
