If you're not currently a user on Cosmo, upon receiving an invitation, you'll get an email prompting you to set up your password. Once you've done that and logged in, you'll be directed to the invitations page. There, you'll have the option to either accept or decline the invitation.

If you're already a user on Cosmo and receive an invitation, you'll get an email that guides you to the invitations page. Once there, you'll have the option to either accept or decline the invitation.
