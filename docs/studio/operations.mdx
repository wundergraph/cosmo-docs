The Operations page provides a comprehensive view into your operations, allowing you to monitor and analyze your operations with detailed metrics, client usage data, and performance insights.

## Why Use the Operations Page

- **Track All Operations**: Monitor and analyze all the operations executed against your federated graph
- **Analyze Deprecated Fields**: Identify operations that use deprecated schema fields and determine which clients are affected
- **Make Safe Schema Changes**: Use deprecated field usage data to decide whether it's safe to remove deprecated fields
- **Monitor Client Usage**: Track how different clients interact with your operations and identify usage patterns
- **Debug Performance Issues**: Sort operations by latency or error rate to quickly identify problematic operations
- **Plan Schema Evolution**: Use client and deprecated field usage data to plan migration timelines and communicate changes

## Page Layout

The Operations page features a responsive two-panel layout designed for efficient operation analysis:

### Left Panel - Operations List

The left panel displays a searchable, filterable list of all operations executed against your federated graph. Each operation shows:

- **Operation Name**: The name of the GraphQL operation (or "Unnamed Operation" for operations without names)
- **Operation Type**: Query, Mutation, or Subscription
- **Performance Metrics**: Based on your selected sorting criteria (latency, request count, or error rate)
- **Deprecated Fields Indicator**: Visual indicator if the operation uses deprecated schema fields

### Right Panel - Operation Details & Analytics

The right panel dynamically displays either:

- **Overview Analytics**: Aggregate metrics for all operations when no specific operation is selected
- **Operation-Specific Analytics**: Detailed metrics and insights for a selected operation

## Search and Filtering

### Search and Sorting

Use the search and sorting functionality to quickly find and organize operations:

- **Text Search**: Search by operation name or hash
- **Sort by Metrics**: Choose from Request Count (default), Latency, or Error Rate
- **Sort Direction**: Toggle between ascending and descending order

### Advanced Filters

#### Deprecated Fields Filter

Enable the "Show only operations with deprecated fields" filter to:

- Identify operations using deprecated schema fields
- Monitor deprecated field usage over time

#### Client Name Filter

Filter operations by specific clients when multiple clients access your graph:

- View operations from specific clients
- Analyze client-specific usage patterns

## Operation Selection and Analysis

### Selecting an Operation

Click on any operation in the left panel to view detailed analytics:

- **Operation Hash**: Unique identifier for the operation
- **Operation Content**: View the full GraphQL operation document
- **Client Usage**: View client usage information for the operation
- **Deprecated Fields**: View deprecated fields used by the operation
- **Performance History**: Historical metrics and trends

### Operation Actions

When an operation is selected, you can:

#### View Traces

- Navigate directly to the Analytics Traces page
- Pre-filtered to show traces for the selected operation
- Maintain current date range and filters

#### View Operation Content

- Open a modal displaying the complete GraphQL operation
- Syntax highlighting for better readability

## Analytics and Metrics

### Date Range Selection

Control the time period for your analytics:

- **Predefined Ranges**: Last 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, etc.
- **Custom Date Range**: Select specific start and end dates
- **Analytics Retention**: Respects your plan's analytics retention limits
- **Real-time Updates**: Refresh data manually or set automatic refresh intervals

### Performance Metrics Cards

- **Request Metrics**: Request rate over time and visual charts showing request patterns
- **Latency Metrics**: P95 latency and visual chart of response times
- **Error Metrics**: Error rate percentage and error patterns over time
