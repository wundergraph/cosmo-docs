The Operations page provides a comprehensive view into your operations, allowing you to monitor and analyze performance with detailed metrics, client usage data, and insights.

## Why Use the Operations Page

- **Track All Operations**: Monitor every operation executed against your federated graph
- **Analyze Deprecated Fields**: Identify which operations use deprecated schema fields and affected clients
- **Make Safe Schema Changes**: Use usage data to safely remove deprecated fields
- **Monitor Client Usage**: Track how different clients interact with your operations and identify usage patterns
- **Debug Performance Issues**: Sort operations by latency or error rate to quickly identify problematic operations
- **Plan Schema Evolution**: Use data-driven insights for migration planning and client communication

## Page Layout

The Operations page features a responsive two-panel layout designed for efficient operation analysis:

### Operations List

The left panel displays a searchable, filterable list of all operations executed against your federated graph.

**Search and Filtering Options:**

- **Text Search**: Search by operation name or hash
- **Sort by Metrics**: Choose from Request Count (default), Latency, or Error Rate
- **Sort Direction**: Toggle between ascending and descending order
- **Deprecated Fields Filter**: Show only operations with deprecated fields to focus on operations that need attention during schema evolution
- **Client Name Filter**: Filter operations by specific clients to analyze client-specific usage patterns and behavior
- **Flexible Date Ranges**: Choose from predefined ranges or set custom dates, respecting your plan's retention limits

**Each operation displays:**

- **Operation Name**: The name of the GraphQL operation (or "Unnamed Operation" for operations without names)
- **Operation Type**: Query, Mutation, or Subscription
- **Performance Metrics**: Based on your selected sorting criteria (latency, request count, or error rate)
- **Deprecated Fields Indicator**: Visual indicator if the operation uses deprecated schema fields

### Operation Details & Analytics

The operation details and analytics panel dynamically displays either:

- **Overview Analytics**: Aggregate metrics for all operations when no specific operation is selected
- **Operation-Specific Analytics**: Detailed metrics and insights for a selected operation

Click on any operation in the left panel to view detailed details and analytics:

- **Client Usage**: View client usage information for the operation
- **Deprecated Fields**: List of deprecated fields used by the operation
- **Performance Metrics**: Based on your selected sorting criteria (latency, request count, or error rate)
