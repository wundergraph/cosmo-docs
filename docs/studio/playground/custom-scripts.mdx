Create one or more scripts to handle various stages of the request lifecycle for your operations. Incorporate functionality for working with external APIs, authentication tokens, utilizing environment variables, and injecting headers as needed.

## Script Types

- **Pre-Flight Scripts**: This script runs across all instances of the playground and its various tabs. It executes first, before the request is sent to the router. Use pre-flight scripts to set headers or perform authentication workflows. These scripts are enabled by default.

- **Operation Scripts**: These scripts run either before or after executing an operation and are scoped to a single tab in the playground. By default, they are disabled.

  - **Pre-Operation Scripts**: Executed after the pre-flight script but before the request reaches the router, these scripts function similarly to pre-flight scripts but are applied on a per-operation basis.

  - **Post-Operation Scripts**: These scripts run after the operation completes. Here, you can access the response body and perform any necessary validation steps.

## Creating and running scripts

You can create multiple scripts of each type and select the appropriate one as needed. All created scripts are accessible at the account level; however, scripts selected for use are scoped specifically to your device or browser.

<Note>
  Scripts are stored in plain text in the database, so avoid including any
  sensitive information directly in the script. For sensitive data, use
  environment variables instead, as these are scoped to your device or browser.
</Note>

To configure scripts for your operations, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to the Script Editor">
    In the playground, locate the script editor in the bottom-left corner. Here,
    you can edit **Pre-Flight Scripts** and, under the **Operation Scripts** tab
    (next to **Variables** and **Headers**), configure operation scripts for the
    active tab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit or Create a Script">
    Click on the **edit icon** to modify the script. A modal will open, with a
    **Create** button, allowing you to create a new script within your
    organization.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter and Test the Script">
    Input your script code in the editor. To test it, run the script directly in
    the console. You can also manage environment variables using the
    **Environment Variables** editor, which is formatted in JSON.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set the Script for Use">
    Click **Use Script** to set it as the script to be used.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable the Script">
    Once the modal closes, ensure that the checkbox next to the script is ticked
    to enable it.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run Your Operation">
    With the script configured and enabled, proceed to run your operation.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Environment Variables

Environment variables are local key-value pairs stored as JSON within your browser. Since scripts are stored in plain text, sensitive information should not be embedded directly in the script; instead, use environment variables for this purpose. You can edit and manage these variables through the script editor.

### Usage in Headers

In the playground's **Headers** tab, you can reference an environment variable by using the syntax `{{key}}`. The playground will replace `{{key}}` with the corresponding value from the environment variables before executing your operation.

## Examples

### Accessing Environment Variables

Retrieve environment variables that can be defined in the script window or set using the `set` command.

```bash
const apiKey = playground.env.get("apiKey");
```

### Setting Environment Variables

This example illustrates how to assign a value as an environment variable, making it accessible to other scripts or headers. In this case, the authentication token is stored for later use.

```bash
const clientSecret = playground.env.get("clientSecret");
const clientId = playground.env.get("clientId");

const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/auth/token', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
        clientId,
        clientSecret,
    })
});

const data = await response.json();
playground.env.set('token', data.token);
```

### Logging Request Metadata

Log the metadata of a request, including the request body, operation name, and query, for debugging purposes.

```bash
console.log(playground.request.body.variables)
console.log(playground.request.body.operationName)
console.log(playground.request.body.query)
```

### Validating the Response

Use this post-operation script to validate the response of an operation and ensure it meets expectations.

```bash
const responseBody = playground.response.body

if (responseBody.data.user) {
    console.warn('User not found in response');
} else {
    console.log('Operation completed successfully');
}
```

### Transform and log Response

This example demonstrates how to access, modify, and log the operation response. The transformation includes anonymizing sensitive data, such as obfuscating a user's email address.

```bash
const responseBody = playground.response.body;

if (responseBody.data && responseBody.data.user) {
    // Obfuscate the user's email by replacing the domain
    responseBody.data.user.email = `***`;
    console.log('Transformed response:', responseBody);
} else {
    console.warn('User not found in response');
}
```

### Using Cryptography functions

Scripts support the use of CryptoJS, which provides convenient cryptographic methods to enhance your scripts securely.

```bash
const encryptedToken = playground.env.get('refreshToken'); // Encoded refresh token
const secretKey = playground.env.get('encryptionKey');

// Decode the token
const decryptedBytes = playground.CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(encryptedToken, secretKey);
const decodedToken = decryptedBytes.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8);
const tokenData = JSON.parse(decodedToken);

const tokenExpiry = tokenData.exp * 1000;
console.log(tokenExpiry)
```
