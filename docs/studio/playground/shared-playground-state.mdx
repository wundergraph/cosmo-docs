## What's Included in the Share Link?

When creating a shareable link, you can **choose which parts** of your Playground session to include.

Here's what you can share:

| Option                                            | Included by Default | Required |
| :------------------------------------------------ | :------------------ | -------- |
| GraphQL Operation (query, mutation, subscription) | ✅ Yes               | ✅ Yes    |
| Variables                                         | ❌ Optional          | ❌ No     |
| Headers                                           | ❌ Optional          | ❌ No     |

<Note>
  The **GraphQL operation is always included**. If variables or headers are not defined, they will appear in a disabled section labeled "No content available to share. Add content to enable sharing these options"
