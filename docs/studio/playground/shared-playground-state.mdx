## What's Included in the Share Link?

When creating a shareable link, you can **choose which parts** of your Playground session to include.

Here's what you can share:

| Option            | Shareable? | Required | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| :---------------- | :--------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GraphQL Operation | Always     | Yes      | Always included by default. Cannot be deselected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Variables         | If present | No       | Included only when content is available and the option is selected. If no content is present, the option appears disabled under "No content available to share. Add content to enable sharing these options." To enable it, add relevant content in the Playground. |
| Headers           | If present | No       | Included only when content is available and the option is selected. If no content is present, the option appears disabled under "No content available to share. Add content to enable sharing these options." To enable it, add relevant content in the Playground. |

<Note>
  The GraphQL Operation could be a query, mutation or subscription

## Opening a Shared Link

Recipients of a shared link will see the shared Playground session in a new tab with:

- The **operation** restored exactly as composed
- Optional **variables** and **headers** if they were included

## Not Included in Shared Links

The following are never included in the shared link:

- Pre-flight scripts
- Pre-operation scripts
- Post-operation scripts

## Security Considerations

If you choose to include headers, they are compressed and encoded as part of the generated URL. While the data is not human-readable, it is accessible to anyone who has the link. For your safety, avoid including sensitive data such as API tokens or credentials in shared headers.

## Use Cases

- Share reproducible bugs with your team
- Collaborate on queries with full context
- Link to example queries in internal docs
- Speed up onboarding of new developers with pre-filled queries
