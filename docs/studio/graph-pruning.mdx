## Rules

1. UNUSED_FIELDS

   - Identifies and lists all fields that are not being used in the schema.

2. DEPRECATED_FIELDS

   - Detects fields that have been deprecated but have not yet been removed from the schema.

3. REQUIRE_DEPRECATION_BEFORE_DELETION

   - Identifies fields that were deleted without being marked as deprecated beforehand.

## Rule Configurations

### Severity Level

- Error:- If any configured rules are violated, it causes the check operation to fail.

- Warning:- If any configured rules are violated, they are flagged as warnings, but they don't cause the check operation to fail.

### Grace Period

This is the time period provided to the fields modified on schema publications, allowing time before enforcing these rules during checks.

### Schema Usage Check Period (Enterprise only)

- This is the time period used to check the usage of the field.

- For non-enterprise customers, the value is determined by the limits imposed on the organization according to its current billing plan.
