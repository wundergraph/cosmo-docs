<Note>
    To create, modify, or delete groups, you need to have RBAC enabled for your organization. This feature is available starting on the Scale plan.
</Note>

Groups let you manage team access to specific resources without manual setup, and include the benefits of SCIM integration.

Groups can be linked to both your organization members and your [API Keys](/studio/api-keys), enabling flexible and centralized access management.

### How to delete a group

<Info>
    Groups marked as `builtin` cannot be deleted.
</Info>

To delete an existing group, click on the three dots to the right of the groups table and click **Delete**. From there, one of two scenarios may occur.

**Scenario 1**: The group has not been assigned to any member, API key and/or OIDC mapper.

This is the simplest scenario, as you'll only need to fill the confirmation input and press the **Delete group** button.

  />
</Frame>

**Scenario 2**: The group is being used by a member, API key and/or OIDC mapper.

For this scenario, you'll be shown what is using the group and you'll need to select a group to move the objects using the group to. After that, you'll just have to fill the confirmation and press the **Delete group** button.
