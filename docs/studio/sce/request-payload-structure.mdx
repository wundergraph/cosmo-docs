description: "Definition of the request payload structure for Subgraph Check Extension."
---

When the subgraph check extension is triggered, your registered endpoint will receive a request with a `JSON` payload
containing information about the check. You can use this information to decide whether you want to discard or perform
any additional linting on your subgraphs.

If no option is enabled for the [namespace configuration](/studio/subgraph-check-extensions#configuration), no file
will be generated and the `url` field will be `undefined` or no present in the request payload.
