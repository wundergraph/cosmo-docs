description: "Definition of the request payload structure for Subgraph Check Extension."
---

When the Subgraph Check Extension is triggered, your registered endpoint receives a request with a `JSON` payload
containing information about the check. You can use this information to decide whether to discard the check or perform
any additional linting on your subgraphs.

If no option is enabled in the [namespace configuration](/studio/subgraph-check-extensions#configuration), no file
is generated and the `url` field will be `undefined` or not present in the request payload.
