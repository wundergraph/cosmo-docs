  </Step>
  <Step>Enable the linter.</Step>
  <Step>
    Configure the lint rules and their respective severity levels once enabled.

Once the linter is enabled and the rules are configured, the lint check will be
performed on every [check](/cli/subgraph/check) operation of that namespace.

### Severity Level

- Error:- If any configured rules are violated, it causes the check operation to fail.

- Warning:- If any configured rules are violated, they are flagged as warnings, but they don't cause the check operation to fail.

## Schema Checks

To configure how far back in date the operation checks look at traffic follow these steps:

- Navigate to the Policies page on Cosmo.
- Select the namespace.
