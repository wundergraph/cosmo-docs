<Info>
    We have updated how the RBAC (Resource-based access control) works and deprecated assigning resources directly to API Keys.
</Info>

To create an API Key with limited resources you'll have to [create a new group](/studio/groups#how-to-create-a-group) for the API Key or use an existing group with that have been configured with the expected limitations.

<Note>
    Existing API Keys have been assigned the same group as the member that created them, with the limitation of API Keys which resources.

    For API Keys with resources, we have kept the legacy validation in place but we highly recommend to migrate them to the new groups system.
