### Date Range

The date range filter lets you narrow down the list of requests based on when they were made. You can select one of the pre-defined ranges or select a custom date and time.

### Filters

Filters allow you to narrow down to specific requests and are a powerful tool to find and debug GraphQL requests.

*The available filters can be different depending on the selected date range or grouping field.*

### Grouping

The grouping feature allows you to group the data in the table by none, operation name, client, or error message.

* **None**: The default view with no grouping applied. Each row represents an individual request made to the federated graph.

* **Operation Name**: Grouping by operation name will cluster the requests based on the operation type that was executed.

  * **Client**: Grouping by client allows you to see all the requests made by a particular client and client version. These are read from the headers `graphql-client-name` and `graphql-client-version` that you can set on your client application.

* **Error Message**: Grouping by error message clusters all requests that resulted in the same error message. This grouping can be particularly useful for identifying and diagnosing common errors.

Clicking on a row under groups other than \`none\` will relink the table to "group by none" and apply the appropriate filter. For example, if you click on a row in "group by operation name", it will take you back to the table grouped by none but only show requests with the operation name you selected.
