In order to properly identify different clients on the platform, you must provide the Client Name and Version in the form headers with every request. We support two different variants.

This variant is vendor neutral and highly **recommended**.

```bash
"GraphQL-Client-Name": "name",
"GraphQL-Client-Version": "0.0.1"
```

We also support the Apollo variant for migration reasons and overall better ecosystem support.

```bash
"ApolloGraphQL-Client-Name": "name",
"ApolloGraphQL-Client-Version": "0.0.1"
```
