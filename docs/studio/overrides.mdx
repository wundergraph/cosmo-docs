## Configuring overrides

When you run a check against a subgraph, we detect breaking changes that affect operations. On the check page, you can configure overrides for each operation to ignore specific breaking changes in future checks.

<Info>
  Applying overrides will not change the outcome of the check run. Only future checks will take them into account.

You can toggle overrides for all changes from the **Overrides** menu. Select **Ignore all changes** to apply overrides so future checks do not treat the listed breaking changes as breaking for the operation. Select **Ignore operation** to exclude the entire operation from future checks.

## Viewing all overrides

You can view all overrides in a single place. From here you can open the configuration to fine tune existing overrides or go to metrics/traces to check current usage.
