## Configuring overrides

Whenever you run a check against a subgraph we detect breaking changes that affect various operations. On the check page, for each operation you can configure overrides so future checks ignore specific breaking changes.

<Info>
  Applying overrides will not change the outcome of the check run. Only future checks will take them into account.

You can also toggle overrides for all changes from the **Overrides** menu. Choosing **Ignore all changes** will apply overrides so future checks do not treat the listed breaking changes as breaking for the operation. Use **Ignore operation** to exclude the entire operation from future checks.

## Viewing all overrides

You can view all overrides in a single place. From here you can open the configuration to fine tune existing overrides or go to metrics/traces to check current usage.
