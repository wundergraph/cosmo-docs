Once the linter is enabled and the rules are configured, the lint check will be performed on every [check](/cli/subgraph/check) operation of that namespace.

### Severity Level

* Error:- If any configured rules are violated, it causes the check operation to fail.

* Warning:- If any configured rules are violated, they are flagged as warnings, but they don't cause the check operation to fail.
