Once you have clicked on "Migrate from Apollo", a modal will appear. This modal will request your "Graph API Key" for the federated graph you wish to migrate.

{% hint style="info" %}
Your API key is never saved nor stored; it is only temporarily used to fetch the necessary data for migration.
{% endhint %}

### Steps to fetch the graph API key

* Navigate to Apollo GraphOS Studio.
* Select the graph that has to be migrated.

Once you have acquired the key, paste the key into the Graph API Key input, type the name of the variant to be migrated into the Graph Variant Name input and click on the "Migrate" button.

That's it! After a few seconds, your graphs will have been successfully migrated to WunderGraph Cosmo.
