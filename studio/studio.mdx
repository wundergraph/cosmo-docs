The documentation serves as the central space for detailing the federated graph or subgraph. It allows for sharing common information with the whole organization. It may include details about the responsibility of the graph as well as contact information about the maintainers.

The documentation page can be added to your federated or subgraph by adding the `--readme` option in the [wgc](/cli/intro) cli when creating or updating graphs.
