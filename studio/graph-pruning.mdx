## Rules

1. UNUSED\_FIELDS

   * Identifies and lists all fields that are not being used in the schema.

2. DEPRECATED\_FIELDS

   * Detects fields that have been deprecated but have not yet been removed from the schema.

3. REQUIRE\_DEPRECATION\_BEFORE\_DELETION

   * Identifies fields that were deleted without being marked as deprecated beforehand.

## Rule Configurations

### Severity Level

* Error:- If any configured rules are violated, it causes the check operation to fail.

* Warning:- If any configured rules are violated, they are flagged as warnings, but they don't cause the check operation to fail.

### Grace Period

This is the time period provided to the fields modified on schema publications, allowing time before enforcing these rules during checks.

### Schema Usage Check Period (Enterprise only)

* This is the time period used to check the usage of the field.

* For non-enterprise customers, the value is determined by the limits imposed on the organization according to its current billing plan.
