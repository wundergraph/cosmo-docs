## Organization Events

### `FEDERATED_GRAPH_SCHEMA_UPDATED`

Triggered when the federated graph schema has been updated.

* `federated_graph`: An object representing the federated graph details.

  * `id`: The unique identifier for the federated graph.

  * `name`: The name of the federated graph.

  * `namespace`: The namespace of the federated graph

* `errors`: A boolean value indicating whether there were errors during the update.

* `actor_id` (optional): The identifier of the actor updating the schema.

**Sample Payload:**

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "event": "FEDERATED_GRAPH_SCHEMA_UPDATED",
  "payload": {
    "federated_graph": {
      "id": "graph123",
      "name": "MainGraph",
      "namespace": "default"
    },
    "errors": false,
    "actor_id": "user5678"
  }
}
```

## Verification

To ensure the webhook data is coming from a trusted source and hasn't been tampered with during transit, we employ HMAC signatures. When setting up a webhook, you provide a secret. This secret is used to compute a signature that is sent along with each webhook request.

The header containing this signature is `X-Cosmo-Signature-256`.

#### Verification Example

To verify the webhook request, you need to compute the HMAC signature on your server and compare it to the signature in the `X-Cosmo-Signature-256` header.

Here's an example in Node.js:

```js
import crypto from 'crypto';

function verifySignature(body, receivedSignature, secret) {
  const computedSignature = crypto
    .createHmac('sha256', secret)
    .update(body)
    .digest('hex');

  return computedSignature === receivedSignature;
}

// Usage:
const isVerified = verifySignature(JSON.stringify(req.body), req.headers['x-cosmo-signature-256'], YOUR_SECRET);
```
