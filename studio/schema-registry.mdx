## Latest Schema State

Shows the most current version of your federated graph's schema. This schema is the result of the composition of all subgraph schemas. It includes all types, fields, directives, and other schema elements that define your federated graph.

## Subgraph Schemas

In addition to the federated schema, this page also shows the individual schemas of all subgraphs in your federated graph. Select the one you want to view from the dropdown.

## Copy and Download Schemas

You'll find buttons to copy or download the schema as a `.graphql` file, which you can open in any text editor or import into various development tools.

## Last Updated

This timestamp shows when the schema was last updated. It helps you to keep track of schema changes and to ensure that you're always working with the latest version.
