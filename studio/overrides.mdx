## Configuring overrides

Whenever you run a check against a subgraph we detect breaking changes that affect various operations. On the check page, for each operation you can configure overrides whether they are safe or not.

<Info>
  Applying overrides will not change the outcome of the check run. Only future checks will take them into account.

You can also toggle overrides for all changes in the click of a button. Setting `Ignore All` will consider all current and new breaking changes as safe for the operation.

## Viewing all overrides

You can view all overrides in a single place. From here you can open the configuration to fine tune existing overrides or go to metrics/traces to check current usage.
