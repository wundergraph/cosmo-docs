Federated graphs are composed of "base subgraphs". Feature subgraphs represent a replacement (or "override") for a specific base subgraph. A feature subgraph exists only as long as its base subgraph also exists.

Creating a feature subgraph does nothing in isolation. It must be added to an enabled [feature flag](/concepts/feature-flags) to be considered by composition.
