# Create

## Usage

#### Exclude (the items that have the tag(s) specified will be removed from the federated graph)

{% code fullWidth="false" %}
```bash
npx wgc contract create <name> --source <federated-graph-name> --exclude internal -r <routing-url> 
```
{% endcode %}

#### Include (the items that do _not_ have the tag(s) specified will be removed from the federated graph)

{% code fullWidth="false" %}
```bash
npx wgc contract create <name> --source <federated-graph-name> --include public -r <routing-url> 
```
{% endcode %}

## Description

The `npx wgc contract create` command allows you to create a contract from a federated graph  or monograph by providing tags to exclude from the schema. This will create a new contract graph linked to the source graph.

## Parameters

* `<name>`: The name of the contract graph you want to create.

## Required Options

`-r , --routing-url`: The routing URL of your router. This URL defines the endpoint where the router will be accessible. The contract graph will be accessible through this router.

`--source`: The name of the source graph from which contract is created.

## Options

{% hint style="warning" %}
The --exclude and --include options are currently _mutually exclusive_. An error will be returned if more than one are defined.
{% endhint %}

* `-n, --namespace` : The namespace of the contract graph and source graph (Default: "default").
* `--exclude` : The list of tags that need to be excluded from the source graph schema.
* `--include` : The list of tags that need to be included from the source graph schema.
* `--admission-webhook-url <url>` the base url of the admission webhook. This is the url that the controlplane will use to implement admission control for the contract graph. Example: `https://admission.example.com` (without the `/validate-config` path name)
* `--admission-webhook-secret`: Allows you to sign requests (HMAC) made to your admission webhook url. The header containing this signature is `X-Cosmo-Signature-256`
* `--readme` : The markdown file which describes the contract graph.

## Examples

{% code fullWidth="false" %}
```bash
npx wgc contract create production-external --source production --exlude internal,experimental -r http://router.example.com/graphql
```
{% endcode %}

{% code fullWidth="false" %}
```bash
npx wgc contract create production-external --source production --include public,api -r http://router.example.com/graphql
```
{% endcode %}

Create a contract graph named `production-external` from the source graph schema of `production` that excludes all schema elements tagged with `public` or `api`.&#x20;
