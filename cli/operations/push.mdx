### Usage

```bash
wgc operations push -c <client_name> <graph_name> -f <operations_file>
```

### Description

Pushes the provided operations to the control plane, enabling them to be used from the router when using the given `graph_name`. Additionally, it registers the given `client_name` as a well-known client.

The operations file might be one of the following formats:

* Plain `.graphql` or `.gql` file

* An [Apollo operation manifest](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/kotlin/advanced/persisted-queries/#1-generate-operation-manifest)

* A [Relay QueryMap](https://relay.dev/docs/guides/persisted-queries/)

The operations are validated against the graph schema before registering them. If any of the operations is invalid, no operations will be registered.

### Options

* `-n, --namespace` : The namespace of the federated graph (Default: "default").

* `-c, --client-name <client-name>` The client name / identifier to register these operations under.

* `-f, --file <filename>` Filename to read operations from. This argument can be used multiple times to read operations from multiple files. See [Description](/cli/operations/push#description) for a list of the supported file formats.

* `-q, --quiet` Don't produce any output, just exit with success or error. Intended for use in CI checks.

* `--format <output-format>` Specify an output format for the returned data. Support types include `text` (the default) and `json.`
