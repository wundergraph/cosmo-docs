## Description

The `npx wgc monograph delete` command allows you to delete a monograph on the Cosmo platform's control plane. Deleting a monograph will remove its configuration and associated resources. Use this command with caution, as the action cannot be undone.

## Parameters

* `<name>`: The name of the monograph you want to delete. Replace `<name>` with the name of the monograph you wish to remove.

## Options

`-n, --namespace` : The namespace of the monograph (Default: "default").

`-f, --force` : An optional flag that allows you to force delete the monograph without being prompted for confirmation. Use this option if you want to delete the monograph without additional prompts.

## Examples

```bash
npx wgc monograph delete production
```

Delete the monograph named "production".

```bash
npx wgc monograph delete production -f
```

Force delete the monograph named "production" without confirmation.

## Notes

* The `npx wgc monograph delete` command interacts with the Cosmo platform's control plane to delete the specified monograph. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to perform this operation.

* When using the `--force` option, the command will not prompt for confirmation, so exercise caution to prevent accidental deletions.
