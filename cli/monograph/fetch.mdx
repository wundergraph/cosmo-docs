## Description

* `-n, --namespace` : The namespace of the monograph (Default: "default").

* `-o, --out` : Destination file for the SDL. Prints to standard output if not provided.

## Examples

npx wgc monograph fetch-schema production
```

Fetch the latest valid SDL of the monograph named "production."

```bash
npx wgc monograph fetch-schema production -o production-schema.graphql
```

Fetch the latest valid SDL of the monograph named "production" and save it to a file named "production-schema.graphql."

## Notes

* The `npx wgc monograph fetch-schema` command interacts with the Cosmo platform's control plane to fetch the latest valid SDL of the specified monograph. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to perform this operation.
