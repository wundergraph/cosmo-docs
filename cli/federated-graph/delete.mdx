## Usage

```bash
npx wgc federated-graph delete <name> [-f, --force]
```

<Note>
  **Delete** is an irreversible action. It will delete the entire federated graph, including versions, schema checks, etc. It will not delete the associated subgraphs.
</Note>

<Note>
  Contract Graph behavior: Deleting a federated grpah will delete all associated contract graphs. Deleting a contract graph has no effect on the source federated graph.
</Note>

## Description

The `npx wgc federated-graph delete` command allows you to delete a federated graph on the Cosmo platform's control plane. Deleting a federated graph will remove its configuration and associated resources. Use this command with caution, as the action cannot be undone.

## Parameters

* `<name>`: The name of the federated graph you want to delete. Replace `<name>` with the name of the federated graph you wish to remove.

## Options

`-n, --namespace` : The namespace of the federated graph (Default: "default").

```bash
-f, --force
```

An optional flag that allows you to force delete the federated graph without being prompted for confirmation. Use this option if you want to delete the federated graph without additional prompts.

## Examples

```bash
npx wgc federated-graph delete production
```

Delete the federated graph named "production".

```bash
npx wgc federated-graph delete production -f
```

Force delete the federated graph named "production" without confirmation.

## Notes

* The `npx wgc federated-graph delete` command interacts with the Cosmo platform's control plane to delete the specified federated graph. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to perform this operation.

* When using the `--force` option, the command will not prompt for confirmation, so exercise caution to prevent accidental deletions.
