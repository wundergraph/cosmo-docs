## Usage

```bash
npx wgc federated-graph check <name> --label-matcher <labels...>
```

## Description

The `npx wgc federated-graph check` command allows you to check for composition errors for the new labels provided. The subgraphs which match the labels will be federated and the errors, if they exist will be displayed to the user. This check can be performed without updating the labels of the federated graph.

## Parameters

* `<name>`: The name of the federated graph you want to check for composition errors. Replace `<name>` with the name of the federated graph.

## Options

* `-n, --namespace` : The namespace of the federated graph (Default: "default").

* `--label-matcher <labels...>` : The label matchers to the federated graph with which the check is to be performed

The labels used to select the subgraphs to be federated. Labels are passed in the format `<key>=<value> <key>=<value>`, where each `<key>=<value>` pair represents a label key and its corresponding value. The federated graph will include the subgraphs that match the updated labels.

* `--suppress-warnings`: This flag suppresses any warnings produced by composition.

## Examples

```bash
npx wgc federated-graph check production --label-matcher team=B department=Engineering
```

Checks the federated graph named "production" for composition errors by composing the subgraphs that match the labels "team=B" or "department=Engineering".

```bash
npx wgc federated-graph check production --label-matcher team=B --label-matcher department=Engineering
```

Checks the federated graph named "production" for composition errors by composing the subgraphs that match the labels "team=B" and "department=Engineering".
