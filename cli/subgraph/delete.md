# Delete

## Usage

```bash
npx wgc subgraph delete <name> [-f, --force]
```

{% hint style="info" %}
**Delete** is an irreversible action. However, the change will only be visible to the routers once the composition has been successful. Until then, the routers will operate with the most recent valid composition.
{% endhint %}

## Description

The `npx wgc subgraph delete` command allows you to delete a subgraph on the Cosmo platform's control plane. When you delete a subgraph, all associated data and configurations will be permanently removed. Use this command with caution, as the action cannot be undone.

## Parameters

* `<name>`: The name of the subgraph you want to delete. This should be the exact name of the subgraph you wish to remove.

## Options

* `-n, --namespace` : The namespace of the federated graph (Default: "default").
* `-f, --force`: An optional flag that allows you to force delete the subgraph without being prompted for confirmation. Use this option if you want to delete the subgraph without additional prompts.

## Examples

1.  Delete the subgraph named "products":

    ```bash
    npx wgc subgraph delete products
    ```
2.  Force delete the subgraph named "users" without confirmation:

    ```bash
    npx wgc subgraph delete users -f
    ```

## Notes

* The `npx wgc subgraph delete` command interacts with the Cosmo platform's control plane to delete the specified subgraph.
* When using the `--force` option, the command will not prompt for confirmation, so exercise caution to prevent accidental data loss.
