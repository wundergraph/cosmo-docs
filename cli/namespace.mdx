Namespaces are a way to isolate your federated graphs and subgraphs. They are the way to group graphs in different environments, such as production and staging. For example you can have a federated graph called `my-api` in a production and staging namespace. All graph operations and compositions are scoped to graphs present in a particular namespace. Every organization is provided a `default` namespace which cannot be deleted. You can scope CLI commands to a particular namespace by passing the `-n` flag or `default` is considered.
