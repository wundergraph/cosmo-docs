```bash
npx wgc router download-binary
```

## Description

The latest available router (see [releases](https://github.com/wundergraph/cosmo/releases?q=router\&expanded=true)) of the appropriate architecture will be downloaded to the directory that is specified. The download contents will appear in a folder named "router". Your `.env` file should be placed adjacent to the executable, which should also contain the paths to your router execution config (and config.yaml, if any). See [router configuration](/router/configuration) for more details.
