<Info>
  IMPORTANT: Please note that since this command runs locally, the subgraphs may or may not exist on the control plane. It is recommended to **not** use this for production, if you plan to use the Cosmo platform as schema registry or analytics platform. For production, you can fetch the latest router execution config for your federated graph using the [fetch](/cli/router/fetch) command instead.

## Usage

```bash
npx wgc router compose -i <path-to-input-file>
```

## Description

The `npx wgc router compose` command allows you to compose subgraphs and build a router execution config locally without a connection to the control plane.

## Options

* `-i, --input`: The path to the input config file that contains information about your subgraphs.

* `-o, --out` : Destination file for the router config. Prints to standard output if not provided.

* `--suppress-warnings`: This flag suppresses any warnings produced by composition.

## Input file structure

```bash
version: 1
subgraphs:
  # You can either provide schema file or introspection. File takes precedence
  - name: employees
    routing_url: http://localhost:4001/graphql
    schema:
      file: ./employees.graphql
    subscription:
      url: http://localhost:4001/sse #Optional, defaults to routing_url
      protocol: sse # Optional, defaults to ws (websockets)
      websocket_subprotocol: graphql-ws # Optional, defaults to auto.
      # Available options are auto, graphql-ws, graphql-transport-ws
  - name: family
    routing_url: http://localhost:4002/graphql
    introspection:
      url: http://localhost:4002/graphql
      headers:
        Authorization: 'Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE'
```

## Examples

```bash
npx wgc router compose -i graph.yaml
```

Compose subgraphs mentioned in the input file graph.yaml

```bash
npx wgc router compose -i graph.yaml -o router.json
```

Compose subgraphs mentioned in graph.yaml and write it to `router.json`

## Notes

* The `npx wgc router compose` command does not interact with the control plane and completely runs locally.
