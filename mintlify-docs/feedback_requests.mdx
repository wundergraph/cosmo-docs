title: "Feedback for Mintlify"

seems like this component expects a step "title" or something, spacing looks off

![image.png](/mintlify-docs/image.png)

clicking "wundergraph cosmo" in the sidebar on the docs causes tab crash, i tried pasting an image but:

pasting images in the editor sometimes causes an error i can not screenshot and paste in this document because of the error

sometimes it just pastes an image that's already in the page again?
