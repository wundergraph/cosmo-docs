The Studio is the primary user-friendly way to consume the graphs created through the CLI. You can view all the federated graphs and subgraphs created. When inside the dashboard for a federated graph, you can view connected subgraphs, label matchers, composition status, schema registry, schema checks and so on.

You can view the history of changes made to your federated graph through the changelog. We also bundle the GraphiQL Playground for executing queries and exploring your schema. It also has a nice dashboard to view your analytical data including requests over time and distributed tracing.
