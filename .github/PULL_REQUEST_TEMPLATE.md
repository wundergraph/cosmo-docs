Thank you for contributing to the Cosmo documentation!

PREVIEW DEPLOYMENTS:
When you create this PR, Mintlify will automatically generate a preview deployment.
You'll see a comment from Mintlify with a link to the preview once it's ready.
This typically takes 1-2 minutes after opening the PR.

IMPORTANT: Always check the preview deployment to ensure:
- All your changes render correctly
- Links work as expected
- Images display properly
- Code examples are formatted correctly
- Navigation updates (if any) work as intended

CREATING A GOOD PR:
- Use a clear, descriptive title that summarizes your changes
- Fill out the "Description" section below explaining what you changed and why
- Review your own changes in the "Files changed" tab before requesting review
- If you're adding new pages, ensure they're added to the navigation in docs.json
-->

## Description

<!-- 
Provide a clear description of your documentation changes.
For example:
- What pages did you add, update, or remove?
- What information are you clarifying or adding?
- Are you fixing any errors or outdated information?
