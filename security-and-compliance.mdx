## Security & Privacy by Design

Cosmo follows a strict “security by design” approach to ensure compliance and data protection.

* 100% open-source (Apache 2.0) and can be fully self-hosted.

* Continuously fuzz-tested for security vulnerabilities.

* Supports Trusted Documents, Persisted Operations, and complexity-based rate-limiting to prevent OWASP Top 10 GraphQL security threats.

* SSO support for OIDC and SAML.

## Data Privacy & Information Segregation

By default, sensitive information is segregated from the Cosmo Managed Service.

* The Router is self-hosted in hybrid deployments, and only anonymized metadata is sent to Cosmo Managed Service for analytics and tracing.

* Request/response data never leaves your infrastructure—WunderGraph cannot access your Cosmo Router instance.

* Privacy safeguards are built-in by design and cannot be bypassed, intentionally or accidentally.

## Regulatory Compliance

Cosmo’s security framework and operational controls are designed to meet the highest industry standards, ensuring robust protection for your data and infrastructure:

* **SOC 2 Type II Certified:** Cosmo has achieved SOC 2 Type II certification, verifying that our security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy controls meet the AICPA’s Trust Services Criteria.

* **ISO 27001 (In Preparation):** We are actively working towards ISO 27001 certification and implementing a rigorous Information Security Management System (ISMS) to mitigate security risks.

* **GDPR Compliant:** We adhere to General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requirements, ensuring strict data privacy measures and giving users complete control over their personal data.

* **HIPAA Compliant:** Our infrastructure includes safeguards for handling protected health information (PHI) in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).

To maintain compliance, Cosmo follows these principles:

* **Security by Design:** Implements an ISMS to meet SOC 2 Trust Service Criteria, ensuring security is integrated into every stage of development.

* **Data Privacy & Segregation:** The Cosmo Router is configured by default to prevent sensitive request information from being sent to the Control Plane or Analytics, ensuring data privacy and compliance.

* **Access Controls & Authentication:** This feature supports single sign-on (SSO) via OpenID Connect (OIDC) and Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML), facilitating secure identity management.

* **Audit Logging & Monitoring:** WunderGraph has undergone a comprehensive SOC 2 Type II audit with continuous evidence collection to ensure compliance. This reflects robust audit logging and monitoring practices.

* **Configuration Integrity:** Employs cryptographic validation and signing (HMAC-SHA256) for router configurations to prevent tampering and ensure authenticity.

* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Utilizes RBAC to manage access to resources within the organization, assigning permissions to roles to establish a structured access control system.

* **Advanced Security Configurations:** Provides options to disable introspection, enforce persisted operations, and configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to enhance security posture.

## Metadata Collection Overview

Cosmo collects only anonymized metadata for analytics, schema usage analysis, and tracing. This metadata cannot be linked to request payloads and is used exclusively for analytics.

### GraphQL Request Metadata

* User agent

* HTTP method & URL

* Operation content (no user data)

* Query type

* Operation name & hash

* Response status code

* Request/response content length

* Request duration (latency)

* Inflight request count

* Client name & version

* Organization ID

### Router Metadata

* Name of the running graph

* Used protocol

* Current router binary version

* Current router schema version

* Hostname

* Client IP (anonymized)

* Process ID

* Telemetry service name

* Telemetry SDK version

### Schema Usage Metadata

* Used GraphQL fields

* Used GraphQL types, arguments, and input

* Field request count

## Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

WunderGraph minimizes the collection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), gathering only what is necessary to provide and secure the managed service:

* **User Name & Email:** Required for authentication and access management

* **Audit Trail & Access Log Data:** Maintained for security monitoring and compliance

* **GeoLocation & IP Address:** Used for security measures, including intrusion detection and prevention.

* **User-Provided Content:** Any information the user shares, such as schema discussions or other related contributions.

## Config Validation & Signing

* Router configurations can be updated via CDN or file with cryptographic validation & signing to prevent tampering.

* Before being applied, all configurations must pass an Admission Webhook validation to prevent unauthorized changes.

* Config validation includes signature verification (HMAC-SHA256) to ensure authenticity and integrity.

* To prevent security threats like malicious subgraph redirection, the Router automatically rejects any configuration that fails validation.

* Webhook signature verification (SHA-256) ensures the secure transmission of configuration updates.

* A dedicated signing key ensures that only authorized updates to router configurations are accepted.

* Supports domain-based subgraph URL validation to prevent unauthorized endpoints from being introduced.

* Timing-safe signature verification prevents brute-force attacks on configuration signatures.

## Organizational Security & Compliance

* SOC 2 Type II Certified (Report available upon request).

* ISO 27001 certification in preparation

* An information security management system (ISMS) is in place.

* Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) policies enforce security best practices.

* Continuous security training for WunderGraph staff.

* $5M E\&O and Cyber Insurance Coverage.
